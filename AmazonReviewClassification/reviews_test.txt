The mp3 player I purchased work perfect for three weeks, since then every time it is touched more moved it shuts itself off. When you turn it back on, it goes back to the song that was playing when you first turned it on. It was never dropped or mishandled, so this purchase was very dissapointing.  	0
I purchased three of these this summer. I am now back to purchase something different. For the MP3 part :: One died quickly and quietly. The other two took awhile.   When you first get them they work great but after awhile they start to act up.  At first it is little glitches in the interface and then they just up and stop working.  You can replace the battery and do a reset but that only works temporarily.  It must be some tiny part or something that wears out. The voice recorder and as a Jump drive they are still working today. If you are buying as a JUMPDRIVE and VOICE RECORDER Go for it.  The MP3 part of the deal is not worth the time or money!  	0
Anyone who says this is not a good mp3 player does not know what they are talking about. If you shop around, you can get one for under $100.00. The sound is terrific and the earbuds that it comes with have a great sound. It is not only expandable with cheap SD memory cards, it also has a FM transmitter and an FM radio with a good signal. Simply put, the best MP3 out there, with every feature in players twice as much. Why pay for an I-pod for twice the cost that has no FM radio, no FM transmitter, no expandable memory and is limited on the music files it can download. Lexar should pay me a marketing fee for this review.  	1
I want to give this product a zero rating! Within one month of purchase, the battery lid got broken and I could not put it back. I made a phone call to creative and was told that the battery was NOT covered in warranty. The replacement would cost me $4.9 plus shipping and package with totals around 30. I argured with the CSR and they just rudely hang off the phone. I will never ever buy a creative product again. Guys, if you want to waste your money and be treated rudely, do not hesitate. Otherwise, choose a more honorabl brand!  	0
My product was recieved in a timely manner and was in GREAT condition.  It was everything it was described to be. Easy to use and quite compact.  	1
Seems me that is an excellent product he which will be me of great utility.    	1
Ok, I give it to Philips for the killer good design: this thing looks awesome; i.e. if you like looking at mp3 players, buy it.  However, if you actually like listening to music, go buy a 20$ CD player from Wal-Mart, it will do a better job.  First, the sound is horrible: I bet that the earbuds are to blame (yeah, they look really cool too, but sound like crap), but never got to really buying an upgrade.  Second, the installation software won't even run, unless you have your XP upgraded with every patch imaginable: annoying.  Third, during the very first load, after getting about 130 songs on it, the device froze. I restarted it, added about 40 more and left on a vacation the next day. Guess what? When I turned it on, I had only the last 40 songs on it...   Finally, the device crashed for no reason whatsoever after being turned on and off three times and it took me about 20 minutes to reboot it.  I returned it after 5 days and do not plan on buying another Philips mp3 player any time soon: it's a pitty, it is the best looking player I have seen. It also has three times the capacity of similarly priced players, stores pictures, and has an FM tuner... If the designers would stay and the programmers at Philips would be fired, I would wait in line to get their next product.  	0
bought 3 years ago.  battery always sucked but entire thing died today (despite trying all the "trouble-shooting" tips  Apple offers on website).  very  disappointing considering i paid $300 bucks for 3 years ago.  AVOID simply for the miserably short battery life alone.  almost missing my old walkman.   	0
"Absolutly dreadful", as Simon would say...my mp3 somehow managed to turn my computer upsidedown and nothing will work. Not only that but the player itself refuses to work while trying to download my first CD on the day I purchased it, it just froze and now all it wants is to be hooked to the computer and its been that way for hours. I am returning it back to Best Buy where I got it.  A complete waste of time and money. Not even a single day of it worth while.  	0
I have to give this player 5 stars because I can no longer imagine life without it.  I watch movies on the bus to work, if I'm having lunch by myself in a cafe, sometimes walking to the car from the bus, when I'm waiting for an appointment ... It is totally amazing.  Arriving at the gym without it can be extremely traumatic.  Listening to my favourite songs while doing weights at the gym is magic.   I actually have a 2GB model, but rarely need more than one because everything compresses so much and its so easy to get things on and off it. Some tips that I would have found useful are:  1.  Converting videos.  You first need to get the video into a format that the Samsung software recognises (in order for the program to be able to compress and convert it into an svi file to go on the player).  I understand (of course not through personal experience) that if one were to download a movie that it would probably already be in a format suitable to convert directly by the Samsung software.  Anyway, there are a number of programs that no doubt do similar things but since it took me a number of hours to sort out, I'll let you know that the ones I use are:  DvdFab Express to "backup" a copy protected DVD. Then I get Imtoo DVD Ripper Platinum 4 to convert the backup DVD to an avi file (plays in a DivX player).   Then the Samsung Multimedia player converts the avi to svi. Sounds a little involved but very simple when you've sorted it all out (especially when you run a few of these processes at the same time)!  2. For converting my cds to files recognizable by the player I like WinAmp (which is a free program).  You need to set it up so that it will convert your cds to mp3 or wma format (the default wmp format is not recognisable by the Samsung software).  I found out the hard way that there are about 60 different quality settings for wma.  Converting songs to 1mb each (32kpbs 22kHz stereo cbr) I found gave sufficiently good quality (otherwise its tinny and slow).  Mp3 seems to convert to about 2.5mb per song.   Cons  One problem is that the navigation button (after five weeks of regular but still relatively gentle use) now jams in the up position instead of springing back (so I have to move it back to neutral).  My dilemma is mostly that I love the little thing so much that I can't imagine being without it for the period it would take to fix under warranty ...   The second con is rather minor and is directed at the Samsung software - when I transfer a playlist I have compiled over to the player it goes over in one click.  To remove the playlist however requires deleting every single song one at a time. ie press delete, click "OK" to the question "do you want to delete this file" move the mouse back over to the playlist to delete the next song.  But who knows - maybe there is a simpler way of doing this I'm too daft to it work out! (and in that case maybe someone will let me know ...)      	1
Teenagers love gadgets and this one saved the day.  We bought the Sony MP3 player for Christmas (we opened early) and I set up and downloaded the 5 songs that came free with the purchase of the player.  Setting up the software was a snap, and downloading the free songs was easy.  Moving them over to the player took less than 2 minutes and the playback was wonderful.  My son's friend has the same player, however an older version, and his headphones are not as good as my son's are.  This player has sound volume like I never imagined such a little player would have.  It's small and fits into a shirt pocket easily.  I also love that it came with all connectors and software, to include ear covers.  The music can be stored in folders or individually, which helps keep things in order.  The software also has the ability to transfer your current music into the network format, so you can have your favorite songs (legally purchased) converted over to the player.  I love it, and more importanly, my son really loves it!  	1
The Creative Zen Nano Plus is a great little player. I have not had time to use all of the features yet. I love the color and that was a deciding factor. The only thing that I did not like were the ear buds because they are too large for my ears, fall out and hurt after they have been in for a while.   	1
This was the worst electronics puchase I've ever made.  When I first got the mini it was great, looked nice and sounded great.  Within about 6 months battery life started to go way down, after a year it was down to nothing, didn't work properly, would show a full charge and not last more than 20 minutes.  If you're going to take a chance on an iPod, definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one.  	0
I have had the sansa for 3.5 months now, and have had no major complaints. Works well, easy to use, battery life is above average(I am still on 1st battery, and I use mp3 all the time). It is great for running or working out, won't skip like some hard disk mp3 players.   Is it the best sound in the world? No. But it is adequate, and other buds or headphones can be purchased. The only thing I would change is the playlist function. But putting songs in folders in order and renaming can fix this. It really does not bother me at all. How many entire albums are you going to listen to in a row anyway? Most times it is used while exercising, on the subway, on a plane, etc.  Overall, I highly recommend this little guy, you won't be disappointed!   	1
For the very short period of time it worked, it was great. It began freezing up with software problems, and support is the helplessdesk. These poor people have been contracted by iRiver and abandoned. I really believed, even after many weeks of research, that I was getting a quality product. It is junk. Don't waste your money or your time.   	0
I just bought this tonight.  On my XP system, works great. Don't install their "software"; just plug in to a USB port and use MS Explorer (MyComputer) to transfer files.  Sound is very good. Good ergonomics on the buttons: a lock switch to prevent accidentally pressing buttons. Remembers where you where when turn back on. Voice recorder.  Runs on one AAA battery--good if you don't want to hassle with a recharger. I have no idea how long these last, tho.  I'm upgrading from a CD-based MP3 player, and I use this primarily to listen to voice files, so my expectations/ demands are not great. But all said, this is a good buy.  One thing, MS Explorer doesn't do complete file management; for instance you cannot check "disk" for errors, size, fragmentation, etc. SO this bodes for possible problems down the line if/when file errors develop on the chip.  All n' all, glad I bought it.    	1
Im thinking of getting the Zen Micro.I have search for a while for the right mp3 and this seems to be the one!  It looks very good and seems like it'll work very well.  I personally think its better than the i pod.  My favorite things are the vertical touch pad and the changable battery.!! Thank you for making this MP3!!!!! -Mevis  	1
I'm just trying to be concise and objective, because I can't believe i got screwed twice with Creative. Bottomline is: - their product are priced lower than competition (price/ Mb is attractive), they seem decent with no shiny options, like the kind of equipment you want for your buck. - their product are fragile and faulty. And it's not this particular one (with movable hard disk parts), I own another Creative Muvo c100, and they are reboot with no reason, or freeze. - their software is so painful to master, with little tricks to make it work if you spend litterally hours on it... - and the worse is... their after sales service. People, trust me on this, your Creative piece of equipment will break, other 3 guys (out of 3)in the Office had issues with their Creative: battery, software incompatibility with other softs, movable pieces, cheap buttons, plastic box, screen... Their equipment looks cheap because it is cheap. No other reason. They could compensate this drawback with a good customer service, but I guess they don't have the bucks to serve the US market correctly. The Reps I talked to are decent guys, but they have no policy, no means to do anything. It looks like you talk to a Postal service chief in the 1950's eastearn Europe. in my case, after giving 15bucks for premier postal service, $25 bucks for Creative to look at my Jukebox, they requested 118-143 bucks (depending on the rep i talk to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) to repair their faulty stuff. In order to get that information, it took 20 days, around 30 emails, 3 phone calls over one hour. This is pathetic. Think twice before you want to spare some 50 bucks over an Iriver or other decent mp3 players.  	0
functionality of device itself is good but the software you HAVE to use is terrible.  Why can't it just be drag and drop through windohs explorer?  I just don't understand proprietary third party software.  I bought a Sony cd mp3 player a couple years ago, installed the software and almost immediately uninstalled it because it was so bad and just made mp3 cds with whatever burning software I had--couldn't have been happier that way. In my experience Sony software is far less than functional and is to be avoided and here you are not given the option to not use it unless you just want to use you player as an expensive 1G storage drive.  That alone makes it not worth buying.  Stick with players that are open source.  As for the authorization thing to get files off the player?  I wish there was an option here to give less than one star on the review.  Player sounded good though and didn't have cosmetic problems some note before I returned it.  	0
If you spend some time with this player it is equal to or better then the ipod. I've used an ipod before and its great. But when researching to choose which player I wanted to invest $300 on, I downloaded the manual from each of the players respected manufacturers (apple, sony, iriver, creative). When directly comparing the HD-3 to the ipod (the "most popular player") they both have the same annoying features. Ipod uses only itunes to transfer music and sony uses sonicstage. Sonicstage version 3 was pretty simple to figure out.   I loaded up my library from my pc and then transfered album by album to the hd3. It was the same procedure the ipod manual describes.      The HD3 does have a playlists option in which you bookmark songs. Ipod calls it "on the go something" but both have you hold  a button to add the track to a my favorite playlist which is a few menus away from the opening screen. Its no problem.   Shuffling is also easy to figure out. It's about the same explanation you would see with any sony audio device. I mean the manual came from Japan but its written in english. So stop whinning. The HD3 actually gives you more shuffling options than ipod. You can shuffle all the tracks, or all the albums, or all the artists, or choose to shuffle tracks within an artist or album group.   Overall the HD3 has way better sound and a much longer battery life than any other player including ipod. Plus if the battery dies YOU can replace instead of paying someone to do it. The HD3 is also smaller, sleeker, and looks cooler. Plus when do sony products break? I still use a six year old cd player.  So don't let U2 convince you to buy an ipod. Buy a freaking awesome player that is unique and much cooler.  No I don't work for sony, I work at Publix. Its a grocery store.  	1
The Zen V is a very user friendly device. I have never owned a MP3 player before and had no trouble using this one.  The programs are simple and putting songs on the player is very easy.  It is small and can fit in your pocket.  You may need to get a new set of ear phones, the ones that it came with were rather large and I could not use them.  Other than that, an awesome   product.   	1
When I first purchased my Coby MP3 player, I was very satisfied.  I would have happily given it a "5".  It worked wonderfully.  I have had it for about 3 or 4 months now and am starting to have many technical and other problems.  First, my battery lasts about 1 hour when the player is fully charged.  Second, I have a lot of trouble getting the screen sensors to register.  In other words I have to push on the screen many times before it registers what I want as far as switching songs or turning down the volume.  It often changes screens without my asking it to.  Right now, I can not get the player off of  the radio and continue to get error messages.  Additionally, I purchased one for my 17-year-old son.  His broke within one week.  He put it in his pocket and the heat caused the screen to go black.  He is not rough on his electronics.  	0
I was not impressed with this MP3 player at all. First of all, im not sure if mine was defective but it would only go 2-3 hours of playing time before the battery would flat out die. I tried upgrading the firmware or calibrating the battery beforehand. This brings me to the quality of the design, when I try and get to the battery compartment. You have to remove the entire back cover and then open this other flimsy door to get to the one AA battery. Try and squeeze the battery in the small space while so worried that the small plastic holders are going to break off. One you got that in, you have to carefully position the back cover to fit back on with the metal contacts in place. Whew.<p>Goods:<br>-Nice blue backlight<br>-Small Light Design<br>-Somewhat easy menu system.<br>-Easy to copy songs using iTunes on mac [no experience with pc software]<br>-Fast/Easy USB.<p>Bads:<br>-Cheap flimsy plastic case<br>-Extremely short battery life<br>-Hard to replace batteries [Afraid of breaking something while squeezing that AA in an extremely small plastic holder thing.<br>-Horrible customer service when trying to get it fixed. They keep saying to flash the memory upgrade firmware I have done all that with no avail!<br>-Doesnt use any traditional upgrade memory method [compact flash or smart media] It needs some kind of special backpack to strap on the back for only another 32MB of memory.<p>In conclusion, I would not recommend the Rio 600, even though it was quite cheap. Spend about $20 more for a Creative Labs' Nomad IIc. It has double the memory and easy to expand.  	0
No RAW file support.  I was told by a coworker that these are great storage devices for a DSLR but if you shoot in RAW you are out of luck.  Now I'm looking in to Epson P-3000, P-4000, P-5000 units because they have RAW support as well all the other functions of this unit (as I can tell).  Perhaps these devices just serve different purposes.  This seems to be marketed as a portable media player whereas the Epson units will play video, audio/mp3, and store photos but aren't marketed as mobile DVRs.  	0
This is an excellent player for those of you who dont like to use itunes. The hard drive went out on my first player, so i had to get a replacement, but the replacement works fine. The sound quality is better than my old ipod mini, the battery lasts longer than my ipod mini, and it plays wma. Also it works great with windows media player and my yahoo subscription, which is a big plus for me.  	1
I recently purchased the T30 to replace my Creative Zen Micro which had bit the dust. I wanted a player that would be easy to use for working out and simple to take anywhere. The T30 has managed that and more.I love just hanging it around my neck and listening anywhere. I have XP and WMP10 - but I use Napster and Yahoo to transfer music, they both seem to work better than WMP10. The battery seems to have a good life, and the sound is great. If I had one complaint it would be not being able to do playlists. This might be possible but I have not figured it out yet. The firmware updates were a slight pain - it amounted to doing a manual update first which was hardly difficult. I am fairly computer adept - but nothing was overly difficult. Hey for $99 this little machine rocks. After I got mine - I bought one for my daughter and my brother bought 3 for his family. My husband is waiting patiently for me to order one for him too. Basically we were very happy and satisfied with the T30.  	1
When I first decided to buy a DVR, I looked at Archos. Archos however does not sounded familiar to me, so, I hesitate quite a bit. When I finally got it, all my fears were thrown away. This device is a state-of-the-art DVR.  You will be happy with its small size, weight and functionality to the GO...  	1
Yes, it's small, yes the battery life is excellent and I have to admit that the sound is not bad. That's where it stops with this product. One of the tricky things is when you have to slide the side button in the particular play mode of your choice. The slider button is extremely difficult to adjust. Here's the worst of this product: the accompanying Sonic Music Stage, which is the proprietary program from which to buy and download songs. The program is ATROCIOUS. It's search engine is primitive; for instance: if you want to search for a certain artist, it will come up with a list of songs that may have the closest term to the name, no artist however. So the only way to go is by song title. It doesn't end there: EVERY time I have bought music in the past year I had to wrestle with their internal downloading system. It SAYS it is downloading to your hard drive, but it is only 'pretending' while you sit and wait for hours. When you go to the help site to find out why it was not downloading properly, it kicked me off and I had to log in again, However, the newly bought songs had dissapeared and I had no clue where to look for them, so I had to go to their history site and sift through all the songs I had bought in the past year. Problem: because there was no date of when any of these were downloaded. The program also AUTOMATICALLY groups your downloaded songs without any rhyme or reason, instead of filing them as singles and letting the user decide what to group. Don't buy this product unless you want to load up on frustration instead of downloading music, no matter how computer savy you are. My next MP3 will be a nano ipod, and definitely NOT a Sony product.  	0
This is an excellent video mp3 player,that i perfer over the i pod.Yes i like this better...The unit has very good sound...The screen is bright and sharp...I have transfered 150 songs and a few pictures to this unit...I have only used about 5 percent of its many features...The archos is a real gem...If you purchase this item please make sure the retailer as a good refund/exchange policy,of at least 30 days...I highly recommend this unit 5 star rated thank you stewart L.  	1
I love this thing.  It was a great value, love the arm strap so I can run with it when I use my sports head phones.  Love the pink.  Easy to add music directly from CD w/o storing on computer.  I will consider this brand when I am ready to get a bigger player.  I already filled this one, that is why only 4 stars.    	1
For every one of you who is looking for a way to transfer MP3 files directly to this player (or any other newer NW-EXXX models) follow the link below and download Sony MP3 file manager V2.0: http://www.sonydigital-link.com/DNA/common/asp/details.asp?l=en&v=mp3installer_2_0&m=mp3  You need to install the drivers first so that the Windows would recognize the device. You don't need SonicStage if you use this software to play MP3 files. All you do is to run an executable through MP3FM folder inside the player and drag & drop your MP3 files. Unfortunately I could not find a way to combine/rename folders after the transfer. Even if you organize your mp3 files into folders as you want to access in the player beforehand, after running this software your folder structure will be gone if it's deeper than 1 level.  Apart from this the player sounds very good with an awesome display. VBR (variable bit rate) MP3 files are recognized and played back flawlessly. The track/album access with the dial is also designed very well. On the negative side the player feels a bit too plasticky, not like the earlier titanium NW-MS70D. Also the bag that comes with this player is too big for the player itself. I wish there was a smaller one bundled in.  	1
I just bought this a few days ago. Everything is fine, but the battery seems so short. I charged it with an AC adapter from gomadic and I definitely don't get 15 hours! I goes past the half way mark in about 3 hours and that is lame, but I do play around with it a lot. I also don't like the volume control. It's really hard to press and it should've just been part of the joystick.   	1
to anyone thinking of buying this ipod i would suggest otherwise this is the only ipod i have ever owned so i can not generalize and say that all ipods lack good qualitybut, this does. I had by ipod for no even a year (and took good care of it, not dropping it, carrying it in a protective case) and it died. Just randomly died one day the ipod with the sad face and the exclamation point came up. So thank God i had a warrenty, i got it replaced for free. Everything was great i got it replaced in July 2006, it is now October 2006, and the new one died yesterday. Same thing as the last a "hardware problem". However, now my warrenty is up so in order to get it repaired, i will be charged, and im sure by december it wil have broken again. That is not a chance i am willing to take. As of now i have promised myself to never again purchase a ipod. I am now lookin to purchase either a Philips 30gb mp3 player or a Zen mp3 player, hopefully i will have better luck with either one.  if you purchase this item, good luck =]  	0
This is awful like within 2 weeks it started to develop problems now its just frozen on me its bad  	0
I got my 30 Gig iPod photo yesterday. I LOVE IT. Everyone at school today was jealous of because i have one. I had a 15 GB ipod before it was stolen, and this one is a little bit thicker and heaviver. But really, its so awesome i love it the album art and everything its great. The color screen is really good. get one  	1
When Steve Jobs said the nano wiould be the biggest revolution since the original iPod, he wasn't kidding. The nano is the most impressive thing I have ever held in my hands. I was really into this product from the start, but certain aspects of the player never hit me until I actually held it.  The day I got mine, my jaw droppped. How could something so small be an iPod? Well, after using mine, I know this is by far the best mp3 player I have ever seen.  I wont go into the specs, as other reviewers already have.   But I will state some things that are wrong with it.  First, I was somewhat disapointed to hear it was USB 2.0 only. My old iPod was firewire, and since I have a mac computer, I never really ever used 2.0. The time to load music was noticable. While takes my 3rd gen Ipod to load my entire library only about 5 minutes, it took my nano about 8-10 minutes to lload only 800 songs. Its not that big a deal, but still...  The other thing is not really that big a deal either, but it is something i found wierd about the player. The headphone jack is on the bottom, instead of on top like it had been for 4 years. I mean, its not the end of the world, I just find that choice very odd.  One other thing a lot of people have talked about was value. Yes, this little guy is somewhat of a rip off. Why not just pay $50 more, and get an iPod with 5 times the space? Again, it comes down to "cool" factor, something the Nano drips of.  However, these "flaws" would by no means make me change my mind on my purchase. This is still THE mp3 product on the market. I bought mine becuase I love apple stuff, and my old one was dying on me. Im glad I bought this thing.  	1
"Flawed Fatally" and "SonicStage Suicide" are pretty much right on in their appraisals.    The hardware is awesome.  I don't regret getting this gem.  I just squeezed 20 albums on this puppy with roughly 250+ songs.   And the battery life is spectacular - Sony must employ some of the best power management experts on the planet.    However, and this is the big frustrator, the Sonic software IS the worst piece of crap I've ever used, going back to the DOS days of the '80s.  It's horrendously slow (almost like watching the grass grow), weirdly inaccurate (in it's gauges showing transfers), unintuitive, and basically a scam (my opinion) to get you out to their website to sell you more music.   BTW, since the instruction manual says you can't drag-and-drop MP3s and have them play, and since I tried this and it in fact doesn't work just as the folks at Sony truthfully say, don't believe that you can despite what other reviewers here say.  What you can do is drag-and-drop files, so you could use this as a portable memory stick, but they really don't play... at least I haven't been able to get them to play.    In summary, however bad the software is, the hardware is still amazing and I hope that I won't have to interact with the software too often.  I even went out and downloaded the latest software from the 'net, so don't think this is just an outdated review and new software might be available.  I suggest to Sony that they skip from version 3.2 straight to 5.0, fire all the developers of the present software and go get a team who can whip off something worthwhile.  And, develop drag-and-drop for MP3s.  	1
The SanDisk Sansa View is a pretty nice player from a hardware standpoint. Its build quality is solid, it looks nice, and it has good sound quality if you don't use the stock headphones. Admittedly, it's nothing flashy, but it isn't meant to be - it's a low cost, high capacity MP3 player.  It has one huge failing, however, in the quality of its firmware. It crashes and, despite claims of long battery life, the player only lasts about six hours on a full charge with the latest firmware. Considering I purchased this player for work, that makes it virtually useless to me unless I feel like sitting in silence the last few hours of my shift.   I actually returned one of these thinking that the battery was defective, when in fact the players only manage about 17% of the battery life SanDisk claims. If you don't update the firmware, the problem isn't so bad. I managed about twelve hours on a full charge with the factory firmware, but it had issues with crashing that forced me to update it.  Anyone considering this player might want to give it a few months before jumping on board. It's not bad, but the firmware needs a lot of work. Needless to say, I'll be thinking long and hard before I purchase a SanDisk product within a year of its launch in the future...Then buying something else instead.  It saddens me, honestly, because I really like the player itself. Its simple design really is elegant, the screen is large and clear, and the navigation wheel makes maneuvering menus a breeze. If it could swing even half of the battery life that SanDisk claims, I'd be perfectly happy with the View, but it is very far off the mark. As things stand now, I'm seriously considering a refund to purchase a player from a different manufacturer.  	0
I've rocked out an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y7976/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/002-4812178-4699210">Apple 2 GB iPod Nano White</a> for a while and loved the mobility and such but figured since I'm heading off to an out of state college next year I'm gonna want more then 2GB storage space...which brought me to this iPod video. The upgrade in space is amazing and you dont lose too much of the great mobility the nano affords you. Costs a bit more then then nano but if you search out for one you can find one at a decent price. I got mine for $120 through an Amazon registered seller and it's been perfect.  I highly reccomend for college kids since you and your room mate may differ on what to watch and you might have some down time between classes but not enough to go back to the dorm or lug out and get all set up with a laptop.  Also highly reccomend for somebody whose nano just doesnt hold enough.  	1
I have the Nexus 25 but assume the same problem exists in the 50. When listening to a recorded XM channel, the player automatically drops out (cuts off) the last couple of seconds of each song and the first second or so of the next song. This means you lose the last few notes of every tune and the first few of the next one. This is extremely jarring if you are used to the normal radio listening experience, since like most radio stations, XM's songs are played in a continuous mix without break, meaning normally the next song starts as the previous song fades away without interruption. Even more noticeable is when this happens during spoken moments such as station IDs or jingles. Instead of hearing "The History of Alternative Music, Fred on 44", you instead only get "istory of Alternative Music, Fred on Fo" or instead of "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem", you hear only "rican Top 40 with Casey K". It is just ridiculous and there seems to be no way around it.  	0
Low quality, and poor product support from Creative.  Very disappointed with this product.  It worked for about 6 months of light use, then quit working (turned off or wouldn't turn on at all).  Creative tech support recommended downloading new driver, but this didn't help.  So I was going to send it in because it is still under warranty.  However, they require a non-refundable $25 "diagnostic and handling" fee just to send it in (plus I pay shipping), and there may or may not be additional charges for labor.  This doesn't make sense given the value of the player, so the warranty is basically useless.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and they suggested that next time I buy their enhanced warranty.  I think next time I probably just won't buy a Creative product.    	0
This has to one of the worst items I ever bougth. It destroyed 4 San Disk SD memory cards. I will never buy another Memorex product again because of it.   	0
Wow... This thing is trash. Want the laundry list of reasons why? Of course you do!<p>a)feel cheap-- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily, and it definately wouldnt survive a drop<br>b) the screen is hard to read-- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display<br>c)the scroll bar is a travesty-- enough said<br>d)software is another great misfortune-- hard to operate, crashes frequently, screwed my music library up, doesnt work with mp4s, the list goes on and on<br>e)the case is too small-- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage<br>f)it doesnt look pretty-- spending this kind of cash, you want something that has the asthetics bit down, of course<p>So... Im taking mine back tomorrow morning, and getting a nice shiny new iPod instead. Don't waste your time, engery, resources on this thing, just spend a little more for a far more functional iPod.  	0
We purchased 3 of these for our kids and they love it and have not had any problems with them.  We'll be upgrading them to a nano when the hard drives on these start to fail.  So far they haven't.  	1
I was satisfied with the product - until I actually used it in the real world. The second day I carried it in my pocket (with nothing but my cell phone knocking against it), the glass screen cracked and broke apart. In my pocket. Guess what happened when I reached my hand into my pocket which now had bits of broken glass into it?  The third day I was using the Machspeed Trio was when it died. I put some documents onto the drive and went to Kinkos to get them printed. When I gave the clerk the drive, he was unable to get information off it. He couldn't even get it to register in the computer. He tried it in four different computers, and none of them worked. He gave it back to me, and I couldn't even get it to turn on. I changed the batteries - no good. It just died.  Thanks, Machspeed Trio. I really enjoyed your product for about 18 hours. But $30 for 18 hours isn't enough.  Please don't buy this product.  	0
I am not reviewing how this works b/c i am sure it works as well as all other ipods but......i am shocked how expensive it is for a 4gb player.  I know its an ipod so it will be expensive but you can get a 20gb player (non-ipod) for about the same price, maybe a little more.  It is clear that you are not paying for gbs here but style.  I understand that but it still seems like a high price to pay for fashion.  I just want to listen to music!!!!!  	0
This product gets compared to the iPod Video a lot.  Well, I have both (actually my daughter has the iPod).  If you've got TiVo like we do (or any DVR), the Archos is by FAR the better unit.  Why?  Because it can record DIRECTLY from the video feed.  No messing around with transferring first to a PC, transcoding, etc...  The Archos lets you just plug into the TV and go.  And you can still transfer to and from your PC - very easily - if you prefer to watch there.  I can tell you from the nightmares I've had trying to move TiVo to the iPod that there's simply no comparison.  I'm not picking on the iPod - other PVRs (like the Creative) would have the same issue.  The Archos, as far as I know, is the ONLY unit that lets you skip the computer entirely - which avoids a whole lot of hassle.  It's also a very good music player (and picture viewer).  Yes it's a bit big - you wouldn't go running with it - but as my 'airplane solution' for music and video, it's awesome.  Quality is top-notch as well.  Just buy it.  	1
We got the Sansa shaker for both our kids for Christmas.  My son's lasted 1 day before shutting down.  The replacement lasted a whole 2 days.  Now my daughter's shut down but it's after the return time frame so it looks like we're stuck.  Unfortunately my kids loved it so now we're stuck trying to find something similar.  Definitely not recommended!  	0
I was excited when I got it, then a few weeks later, its just collecting dust on my desk.  Just get a regular ipod, so it can hold more songs, and it will work better.  Also, the back of the zen falls off, and I can't get it back on without taping it.  Also, when I try putting new songs on it, it deletes the other ones!!! This really gets me ticked off, because then I have to delete every song on the list and re-download them all on the same playlist. This is complete junk. I only did 2 stars because it worked for 3 weeks. Now it just doesn't work, even with a new battery.  Yes, it may be very small and it only costs 50 bucks, but its not even worth 50 bucks!! I rather buy 50 bucks worth of Paris Hilton's albums, and listen to it all day!!! (very bad)  	0
This is a great unit.  Got it to record movies for the kids.  Replace portable dvd units that last usually less than a year.  Great product.  Only bad thing is battery does not last as long as I would like for it but I no worse than anything else in this size.  	1
Will do in the market for portable DVD players. Less bulky and smaller in size, with no need to carry a DVD or CD case. Will pay for itself in recorded video that does not have to be purchased. Playback quality is good for both audio and video. Great storage capacity for a broad set of videos, audio and pictures. Product is a real sleeper, not carried in many of the large electronics stores.....probably cause it would cut into the sale of media. Try it, you will like it!  	1
I bought an Ipod shuffle but it went dead within a week. The 512MB Zen plus is a great product. I haven't messed around with the mic recorder yet, but the zen plus has lots of good features.   The Zen plus is Windows 10 capable, and I use it to transfer songs to the player. The Zen Nano plus is a durable player with lots of features and a reasonable pricetag.  Only downside is that's it's made in China, but then again, what isn't these days.   	1
The Good Stuff - Small dimensions, average build-quality - Shiney, polished-metal style materials (plastic, actually)  - 5Gb MicroDrive  - 5-way joystick plus a mechanical wheel-scroller for zooming quickly through lists  - Charges over USB  - Color screen (not TFT, the duller type) - File/Folder browsing AND iD3 based browsing (Artist, Album, Track, Genre, Year, etc)  - Profiling (can scan tracks and self-databased iD3-tag info like Rio Carbon, no software required)  - View photos  - 5-band custom EQ  - Choose MSC or MTP complient in the Settings Menu. First time we've seen this ability. Might as well stick with the Mass Storage Complient option unless you're a big fan of WMP10  - Damn near gapless MP3 playback  - Power output (volume) is very strong, like 50 steppings - Includes a protective case with belt clip and AC adapter (you don't get these with an iPod anymore) - Includes Sennheiser MX400 earbuds which are a lot better than you usually get for freebies  The Bad - No dedicated play controls, use the joystick instead  - Color screen is small (1-inch), colors are washy  - No FM radio or recording  - Can't view photos and listen to music at the same time - Battery life doesn't seem that great so far, like old iPod Minis - case does not have cut-outs for controls or screen  (...)  	1
I really wanted to like this player.  My favorite colors are in the red "family" and the color black, and this player looked sharp, "cute" and simple.  If only it performed as well.  At first it could not detect my computer (I have Windows Vista), so I feared compatibility issues, even though the box indicated it was Vista-ready. Once it finally recognized my laptop, I had to try and learn how to program the thing.  Although this was my first mp3 player, I didn't expect it to be that hard to use.  But I think the problem was simply that the player is defintitely not user-friendly.  I can't tell you how many times I had to revert to the manual to do just about anything.  I am not a stupid person by any means; I just found that the player is not very intuitive.  You basically have two different buttons to navigate with ("menu" and "mode"), but where you go depends on how LONG you press each button.  Pressing quickly brings you to one "place"; pressing a little longer, another.  Then once you get to this particular "sub-level", so to speak, you need to navigate THAT level to get to where you truly want to be.  I found it overly complicated and tedious.  On the plus side, the earphones are great (soundwise).  I have a "regular" pair of Sennheissers, and they can't be beat..however, I find earphone plugs to be rather uncomfortable and sometimes struggle to keep them in my ears.  That is a downside, to me.  Anyway..long story short: After spending hours figuring the player out and adding songs and programming the radio, the player suddenly decided to stop working.  Tsk..and just when I was thinking I might be able to live with the players idiosyncrasies.  So now the player is on its way back to Amazon, and I've barely had it for 24 hours.  I hope anyone else who decides to buy it has a better experience then I did.  As for me, if I've learned anything, it's actually that I probably need to get a "bigger" (i.e more memory) player, anyway. ;-)  	0
Besides the owners manual, and the few problems you might encouter, the mini is great. Despite what other reviewers have said, I have had my mini for about two years, and the battery still seams perfect(I've never done a full battery life check) As for finding out how to upload, download, and use the mini at first,it's a little more tuff. I STILL LOVE THE MINI.  	1
I bought a first generation Dell DJ 15 gb Juxebox in June of 2004 for $199.  Since that time I've had zero problems or complaints.    The battery life is still easily 9+ hours It's survived numerous very hard falls without a problem Everything works perfectly  The only problem I had was with the default Musicmatch software it installs, but it also gives you the option of Dell DJ Explorer software which is as easy and intuitive to use as Windows.  For Christmas I was looking for an mp3 player for my brother and couldn't find anything that came close to the memory storage and quality I bought in 2004 under $200.  I ended up buying a creative zen player and the results were dismal.    I can't believe Dell discontinued such a fine product.  Although I've read about problems with the second generation DJs, I've never heard or read about anyone that had reasonable complaints with the first generation players.  The only complaints I've heard have been with the player's size and with its scrolling wheel.  1. While the player is bigger and heavier than an ipod, it's only about the size of a pack of cards, which is fine by me.  Plus the well constructed and durable frame of the player beats any ipod and provides unparalled protection.  2. The scrolling wheel may be difficult for some to use effectively at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's actually faster than the ipod.  To test this theory I had a race between two of my friends (both ipod owners) and myself to see who could access specific songs and artists the fastest.  The scrolling capabilities of the Dell won hands down.  This is especially true for people who have large amounts of music.  If I was to buy a new mp3 player I would buy the ipod video, but only because its video playing ability is surperlative.  However if video is not important to you, I would highly recommend purchasing the 1st generation dell dj over any other mp3 player on the market.  I've owned an mp3 player since 2000 and have read literally thousands of reviews on different players.  The 1st generation Dell DJ is hands down the best deal out there for your money as long as your priorities are storage space, battery life, and reliable playback.  Note: I'm not one to write reviews, especially long drawn out reviews like this, but there has never been any other electronics product I've ever owned that has served me on a daily basis as reliably as this mp3 player.  	1
This produc was delivered earlier than expected and in great shape.  My family loves having an iPOD to enjoy their favorite music.  Great service and a great item.  Thanks.  	1
Bought this for my husband, he loves it; it works great, looks great, nice small size, highly recommend!  	1
A little Bigger than two Ipod 20 or 30 gig's stacked together (maybe 3), Buttons are durable and rugged..(it will last) I bought it for FM stereo tuner option and price.. Software no problem with XP, uploading songs no problem. I use my BoseTriPortheadphones and sounds great!!! I Recommend it for FM tuner option..  	1
people thunk its bad but its not its a good mp3 from a respected comuter company and it sounds great  	1
Don't buy this the 128Mb version is just about to be made available for just a few pounds more.  	0
This player is WAY too prone to static electricity.  It crashed/rebooted EVERY TIME I touched it.  I returned it for a refund.  	0
Well first of all it hurts my ears whenever I listened to it, which was annoying, and they kept falling out of my ears! Then the battery cover fell off 4 weeks after using it. So I taped it back on but then it got all dirty. Then, I took it to school one day, for the end of the day because I walk home, and it started playing during class! And it was in my purse without anything touching it. I would suggest getting a regular ipod mini.  	0
the company sent me a great product, at a great price. im glad there is an ebay to shop around for great deals.  	1
I saved my money up for this Philips mp3 player.  When I got it I loved it.  I got it in June 2005, it just recently stopped working in January 2007.  It only worked for a year and a half.  I was very disappointed with this mp3.  I will never get this very mp3 again.  	0
The Nano is a good product, and a good value depending on what you're looking for in a music player.   First, the bad. Yes, it scratches and smudges easily. Even moderate handling is likely to leave your beautiful gadget hopelessly marred. That's a fact. I bought a case right away and still have some minor scratches on the surface. If you buy a Nano, buy a case (gel or otherwise) on the same trip--it will save you some trouble down the road. Second, the software needs a little tweaking. While most of the time, it works fine, I did experience a glitch here and there that mysteriously returns me to the main menu. It's not damning, but it can be annoying. Hopefully, Apple will fix this soon. Third, if you're dikkering, as I was between a Shuffle and a Nano, know that the Nano is a bit more delicate. I bought this for working out, and I do worry that I'll have to cash in my Applecare warranty more with this than I ever did with my shuffle. It has a screen, it's smaller, and it's more delicate.  Now, the good. First, it's gorgeous--flat out, a beautiful design. You will marvel at the screen and the impossible thinness. I also own a mini, and as lovely as that is, this is even prettier. Second, again, if you're dikkering between a Shuffle and a Nano, the battery life is quite good. I got about 11 hours on a single charge, and considering the bright color screen, this is great. Additionally, it holds a charge well between uses. Very little power seems to eke out. Third, you can use playlists. If you're like me, and have different playlists for different moods, the Nano is superior to the Shuffle in this respect. Finally, the screen. It's quite nice. I expected to not use it much, but find myself glancing at it constantly for the time of day and song titles (album art is a bonus).   So here's my recommendation: if you don't need your whole collection with you or are considering a shuffle, the Nano is also a great choice. Yes, the screen and front can get marred, but if you invest in a case, you'll be fine. The sound quality is great (better than my Mini) and the form factor is good for workouts or car trips. You really can't go wrong unless you need a higher-capacity player. Great product, overall.  	1
Just like one of the previous user/buyer mentioned, it looked complicated but was really an excellent device once you get to figure out how it really works...my only problem now is how to record tv shows directly to this device and I would have given it a 5 stars then...I have to add that customer service did a good job when I needed assistance too...  	1
I could type all day about the knitpicky waa waa of iPods and Zen players, but what it boils down to is simple, really.  The new series of Zen players are well worth the coin; they're functional; they look good; they sound fantastic, and they cost less than an iPod.  Bottom line.  But hey - buy an iPod if you want - Steve Jobs is the laughing all the way to the bank.   For the record, it was Creative that invented the portable music player, but it was Apple that created something unique with the concept and put marketing muscle behind it.  If you want to be specific, you could say that the iPod is actually an expensive knockoff of the of the older circa 1999 players - yes 1999!  Was there an iPod back then?  Nope.  	1
I still like the their joystick players better, but I need to modify some of my previous comments: 1. The sound quality is pretty good - after you replace the headphones and fiddle with the equalizer and SRS settings. 2. The click wheel for changing volume and settings operates raggedly.  3. It is much clumsier when strapped to your arm than the joystick player. 4.It is extremely difficult to get out of its clear plastic case without damaging the case - but you can correct this by wiping a very fine layer of talcum powder on the inside (got that from a forum).  5.Most annoyingly, whenever you turn it off and back on it forgets all of it's settings.  You have to reset the volume, the equalizer, and the play order - you can correct this by reformatting the flash memory.  It must be formatted in FAT 32.  It comes natively formatted in FAT 16   I'd bump it up to 3.5 stars but they won't let me change that on an edit.   	0
Why I took a chance and bought the Archos 504 and docking station: -- High capacity storage (I have a LOT of music files -- over 30 gigs) -- Handles WMA music files -- can be set up with a dock and remote to play music through the home and office stereo systems (all while keeping its charge) -- Thought I might get into the video part of this thing in the future -- Hoped for a good screen to display some photos -- Liked the fact that file handling could be done as an installed hard disk using Windows Explorer  Really, I was looking for something primarily to make the home or office music experience really nice with a transportable, high capacity, dockable unit for all my (WMA) music files. The video and photo stuff was secondary, but an interesting plus. Though pricey with the dock, I was willing to buy this if it fit my needs. Alas...  Why I sent it back: After a good part of the weekend and then a subsequent 4 or 5 hours on the phone with Archos tech support, we could NOT get any playlists built (other than one on-the-fly one). Tech support was baffled by this, but the process was laborious even had it been successful. The file handling for photos and videos seems okay, but to do music file handling, this thing is pretty bad and much of it is not very intuitive. (And I am fairly tech comfortable in most regards...) The final straw was this lack of ability to construct playlists, one of the most basic needs of a useful and versatile music player. There was almost nothing about the process that tech support led me through that would have been easy to figure out (you don't wind up synching to Windows Media Player, but you somehow are supposed to use WMP to create the playlists and then save them to the Archos). The whole thing was a labyrinth, and then didn't ultimately even work, no matter how many variations we tried, including trying versions 10 and 11 of WMP. The paper manual was just a quick thing, so not useful at all. Unfortunately, the downloadable PDF manual wasn't much better: mediocre in some areas, terrible or downright wrong in others.   I have finally given up on it having the chance to suit my needs, which is too bad because it seems that there are some very good things about this unit that could make it a real winner. The dock was solid and has lots of connection possibilities, the screen is quite good and clear, and videos and photos seemed to be pretty well managed on some levels. As some people have noted, the volume is fairly low but not bad through earphones, and the quality of sound was quite good. (Don't know why they even bother with the external speaker; barely gets any sound at all, and quality is terrible.) Overall, if you primarily want to do photos and video (and are interested in the option for recording videos) and music is of vastly secondary interest, you might still find this to be a very nice unit. If you are also hoping for high quality, smooth management of music, you will likely be sorely disappointed.  	0
When i first considered buying an mp3 player, i had come to believe that the ipod was the best thing out there, but after doing my homework i came across this wonderful device and thanks to the reviews, i picked it. Since then i haven't looked back! This is absolutely amazing. I know that everyone is talking ipod, but if you do your homework you'll find a good number of other competitive devices like the samsung. I really like the fact that i can play videos on this thing, and am even able to download WMA-DRM to media player and then straight onto my device. The text viewer is another nice feature more especially if you read a lot of stuff online, you tend to want to carry it around so i just save it in .txt format and Wham! i can read it anytime anywhere. The photo viewer is also quite neat and the games come handy when you get bored. The Device also functions as a mass storage device which for me as a business person is quite handy even when travelling. With Microsoft releasing a new player by christmas, i'll just add that to my collection of mp3 players. But honestly, Even though you don't get an iTunes experience similar to the ipod, i still prefer this device to an ipod and it's got value for money. If you want to follow the wave of ipod fever, go ahead, but if you need something that you can work and play with, This is the thing. Coz i use mine at work and home. And i would highly reccommend it. I hope this helps!  	1
I needed a voice recorder with portability and usb flash.  I read almost all reviews before I made a decision.  After a few tests, I couldn't agree with the positive reviews here.  This product can be used as a usb flash drive. But if you want to expect a nice mp3 player that can record voices and play it back, you will definitely be disappointed.  I tried to return this product after a few tests. Unlike this seller's pledge like "buy with confidence," this merchandiser does not allow a return of any opened item.  I really hope no one gets frustration by purchasing this useless junkie from this vendor.   	0
I'm a non-technophile, I just want to listen to music as quickly and easily as possible, and the MuVo N200 allows me to do precisely that.  Its plug-n-play and jog away.   Purchased Nov. 9th, the 256 MB model.  Within minutes of getting it out of the box the N200 was on my computer via the provided USB cable and I began dragging and dropping music files into it.  Turned the N200 on and music came flowing out, exactly what I wanted.  Didnt install the software til later, and didnt need to.  Thats how flexible, easy and intuitive the device is to use.   PROS: 1.)  Size - its so small, and very light weight too.  The Professor/Boss will never know you have it in your pocket. 2.)  LED screen - nice back-lighting with easy-to-surf menu. 3.)  Sound quality is very good, and the Equalizer can be custom-set so it sounds exactly as you like it.  Excellent! 4.)  Somewhat less expensive than many others I compared. 5.)  4-button control design is great.  One button is for power/play/pause/off, depending how long the buttom is depressed.  Two others are dedicated to volume high/low.  And the last one is a wheel for selecting menu funtions, press the wheel in to confirm a selection.  Brilliantly simple.  Fits in the palm of the hand and the buttons are easy to recognize by feel alone. 6.)  Every option is included - comes with an energizer battery, an arm band, a nice protective carry case, an USB cable (these arent cheap) and another cable for patching directly into other audio devices: 7.)  One can record from any audio source now, even the FM radio.  It also has a microphone to record and send message files to your girlfriend...trust me, this helps justify the new toy. 8.)  Battery life seems very good so far.  5 hours of loud playing and only 1/3 drop in the battery indicator. 9.)  Name of song being played scrolls across screen during entire song.  Plus time song has been playing and EQ setting. 10.)  Has super fast USB 2 port capability.  But still recognized the slow 1.1 USB port on my old computer and that worked fine too.  Flexibility, I like that. 11.)  *I've heard* that the warranty on this item has been extended compared to previous models, but cant confirm this yet.  See gripes about web support below.   Bottom line:  I love this thing.  It does exactly what it says it would do and the price is right.  Its EASY to use and offers extraordinary flexibility across platforms.  You can get music from just about anything now, just dont forget the cables.   CONS: not to be pessimistic, but this is the most important part in evaluating a potential new purchase:  1.)  Earphones - if you've read reviews of other CREATIVE products then you know the earphones are nothing to write about, so I'll end it here.  Buy your own, they're not expensive. 2.)  FM radio reception only does well with the very strongest of stations.  Mildly strong stations cut in and out while moving about and weaker ones are all static.  Reception is far inferior compared to my 10 year old Walkman so its not me, its the N200. 3.)  Funny, faint buzzing sound every time the LCD backlight is on...which is anytime one pushes a button.  Not a bother really. 4.)  The order of the songs loaded onto the N200 is instantly alphabetized.  Does not retain the order in which you load them or attempt to re-arrange them in Windows.  I've heard there is a way around this, but I dont know how to make play-lists.  I'm no technophile and I dont want to be, I just want to hear music.  This affect/feature is a little annoying. 5.)  Web support - so far I have none.  Tried to register the new product using the included software and continuously received failure messages.  Then it gives the option to register online, so I tried this and found that the N200 is not yet listed as a product on the registration site, so that failed.  I sent technical support an email asking what to do.  Still waiting for an answer.  So I cant determine my warranty details.  I'm sure they'll work it out eventually. 6.)  The case is fragile looking/feeling.  Make use of the nice rubberized carrying case included. 7.)  Menu is nice and easy to use, but the organization is a little random.  Makes it hard to flip flop between FM music and the mp3.  You have to stop jogging and fiddle through the menu.  Once I accidentally erased my station pre-set instead of turning it on.  This menu might have been more logically organized, and almost prevents a 5-star rating.  More like 4 3/4 stars. 8.)  The instruction manual is a little sparse on info, but certainly adequate to get a 'Quick Start', since this thing is so intuitive anyway.  Overall I really like this device and recommend it highly.  Its' a lot of bang for the buck.  	1
Was I ever surprised when my husband purchased this nifty photo iPod for me as a birthday present when they first came out on the market.  Being the techno wizard that he is, he thought it would be fun for me to have not only almost all of my music collection at my fingertips, but to also be able to enjoy many of our family photographs as well.    I'm sorry to say that I don't have any tips for loading all your pictures on because I let my husband play with that part since he's so good at it. But I doubt that I would have had a problem with it either.    As with all iPod products, a case is a necessity to keep it from getting scratched.   I initially had a skin for mine, but wasn't completely happy with that set up.  My bonus daughter gave me a wonderful turquoise leather flip case that allows easy access to the wheel and an unobstructed view of the screen.   With all the other in depth reviews here, I won't go into a lot of the specifics of the technology, except to say that it seems there would be a better way to navigate through to find particular songs or artists or albums.  But whoever thought 10 years ago, we would be able to have this cool device in the first place?  So I'm grateful for what it does do - gives me hours of pleasure listening to all my favorite music and browsing through my photograph collection up close and personal with the easy click and twirl of my fingers or thumb.  I now call my fun new toy "Mimi's Next Generation Brag Book" because while other mothers and grandmothers whip out their photo albums from their handbags to brag on their Johnny and Susie, I whip out my cool new iPod Photo and twirl my thumb around and find extensive files of family photos from weddings and vacations to pictures of our new grandchildren.    Unfortunately, not long ago, I was carrying my iPod in my bag when I threw in a bottle of water without the cap being screwed on properly.  When I discovered the mess in my bag later that day, my iPod was wet, and somehow the inside of the screen was showing moisture.  We dried it out completely -- in a low temp oven -- yes, we did.  The files were intact and the music still played beautifully, but the pictures couldn't be seen clearly because there was no backlight now.  After sending it off to the factory, we received a message that the backlight was damaged.  Replacing that part would have just about paid for a new one, so we opted not to get it repaired.    I still love listening to this iPod and haven't experienced any other problems.  The music comes through beautifully and transports me to another realm when I'm plugged in.    - Victoria Austin ("MiMi" to Sam & Laryn)   	1
This is a really cute looking device -- too bad it doesn't work at all.  The firmware and software combo is horrible.  You cannot simply drag and drop songs to the device.  You MUST use their Philips branded version of MusicMatch Jukebox to transfer songs and it DOES NOT work.  Two phone calls to Philips didn't help either.  They were polite and all but otherwise useless.  I've owned and used MP3 players since they were first introduced and this is by far the most time I have wasted trying to get something to work.  I never did succeed.  	0
very pool quality. actually i want to return this product. i dont know how to do that.  This is worst product from sony. I never expected this from sony.  I spent around $80+ for this product. that is my hard earn money.  	0
The flash drive doesnt get detected at all. The customer service of CENTON doesnt respond. I wish i could get the replacement.  Thanks..  	0
You can read about this great little device's many features in other reviews, so I'll mostly direct this to Mac users.    Apple claims that iTunes supports this mp3 player, but it really doesn't.  You can load mp3's onto it using iTunes on a Mac if you download MuVo Helper, a little freeware application you can find online (search on "muvo helper").  Even with MuVo Helper, however, iTunes can't transfer its playlists to the MuVo; nor can it transfer Audible spoken word files.  Of course, the MuVo won't play Apple iTunes AAC files either--just mp3's.  With a Windows computer (98SE and above), you can upload mp3's and wma's (drag and drop using Windows Explorer, and create playlists by grouping files into folders) and also Audible files (with Audible's Manager program and Creative's new MuVo firmware, which you'll need to download from creativelabs.com).  You might also check out Red Chair Software's Notmad application (redchairsoftware.com), which helps you order songs into playlists.  Otherwise the MuVo can play songs in a few different ways: the order in which you uploaded them, or alphabetical order, or shuffle play.  So... if you have a Mac and no access to a Windows machine, you won't be able to take full advantage of this device.  However, it still makes a worthy alternative to the iPod Shuffle if you don't buy from iTunes: similar price, similar size, removable battery, a pretty good radio with autoscan and presets, and pretty good radio/voice recording as well.  If Creative were to offer a real iTunes plug-in, this would be a little treasure.  	1
and also, doen't have radio FM ... I don't recomend.  	0
I BOUGHT ZEN XTRA  AND THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS THE OS CRASHED OR FROZE UP ON ME. FINALY THIS THIN STOPED WORKING DUE TO HARDDISK PROBLEM. THIS WAS THE BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY AND I RECOMMEND AN IPOD OR IAUDIO X5.   	0
It's that simple. The newest firmware upgrade for this player halts mid-install, not completely installing. The player will not start, Windows will recognize the player, but because there is not a complete set of firmware on the player, Creative's own software will not recognize it (thus not allowing me to run another firmware upgrade on the player). Do not buy this product.  By the way, I'm not alone with my complaint. The creative forums are plagued with complaints of this.  	0
I bought my pad 1 month ago. I thought before I got it that a laptop and a treo phone were all I would ever need. But then after owning the pad I am ready to chuck the treo for a small phone and my laptop well its too big for real portablitly around the house and town. Plus my laptop is way too fragile...cant tell you how many times I have hit a door with its. Once needed a new screen! The Pad has done way more for me then I ever expected it to and I would highly reccomend it to anyone looking for an all in one device that can change the way they comute and work. Currently I have got music on my pad and videos....that was a no brainer and works as one would expect. What it also does is allow me to control all my remote control devices around my house. Its simple setup allows me to have full tv control in my my three rooms that have entertainment systems in it. Not only does it control the devices, but I swear its respose time just flipping channels on cable is faster than the actual cable remote. I also used to use a logitech remote that I thought was the best ever until I realized my pads potential at this. One Large touchscreen gives me access to every button I need on one screen. I even got it to control my lighting in the house (I have infrared activated lighting by lighttroller in most rooms).  Plus my logitech did not allow me to surf the web while controling my tv and checking email and more.  The beuaty of the pad is that while doing the above mentioned, I can still of course check email and browse the web from anywhere. Not only that I have a pool and though it is too cold right now the pad is splash proof and a perfect tool for surfing next to water. I have tested this theory while my wife gives baths to my young infant son (better know as splash boy while bathing!). Also being a fervent hater of internet explorer I was excited to see that the pad utilizes the far superior firefox browser for surfing and with its large screen it is a REAL surfing experience unlike a treo (dont know why they even sell that thing with a web browser...they should call it a web let down).  The pad has some other features...my wife (sadly) likes to read ebooks....only sad cause she does it with MY pad :) The pad also allows me to write and store text files for use with microsft word later. Something I need to do for work. The keyboard on either side is very easy to get used to...it only took a day before I was typing as fast as I do with a regular keyboard (plus I hear you can buy a keyboard for it if you need one). The internet radio feature also works great...especially since the built in speakers actually sound better than the ones on my laptop and certainly my treo. Pepper also sends the device with some wonderful preset choices so you dont need to configure it to do this...it does it right outta the box.   Another feature that is great for me cause I work out of my home a lot is that I need to constantly be checking IM and email in order to stay intouch with the office and clients. The pad is by my side when in bed, I take it in the bathroom (yes yes I do)....and can even use it while I "pretend" to work and am at my neighbors house. The pad has a great chatting tool that is compatible with my aim account and allows me to instantly know when someone is contacting me...people actually think I have no life and am always by my computer...but the pad has only made it appear that way....and why not....isnt that what working from home is REALLY about?   The pads batteries last me all day and I love the fact that there is no boot up time. The pad turns on instantly like the treo...and unlike any laptop. My only complaint about the pad is how do I stop my wife from borrowing it? hah. Guess it might be time for a second Pad! oh well no device is perfect :)  Bottom line, try the pad and you wont be sorry. I am a computer guy and love it, but I also see it being great for someone who just needs simple computing capabilites and does not want to be burdened by virus/spyware prone pc's or complex setups. The pad was so simple a manual is toatlly not needed. Once you recieve it, it asks a few questions and off you go. It reads my cameras sd cards and hooks to my pc for syncing with my necessary stuff when I need to. Its the ultimate toy..now all I need is a new cell phone and I am set.  One other thing that I like....when I do travel with the pad....people stare...people ask...what is that? then I repeat what I just said above. Its cool factor is also a 10!   	1
I love the Ipod when it works, but I have had three die on me out of the blue.  I have taken care of all of them.  They have not been dropped or exposed to high or low temperatures.  It's easy to get them replaced if you pay extra for Applecare.  That's definitely worth it.  If you have not already invested in getting your music onto Itunes, look closedly at other MP3 players before getting locked into Ipod.  At this point, I have 6000 songs rated on Itunes.  It would take too much time to switch.  	0
This item's USB device was not recognized by Windows.   	0
For me and others the rio 600 was a long awaited electronic device.  Sadly my first rio was a dud.  It cracked and poped and sped up and slowed down unexpectedly.  It also thought every song was under a minute and half even  though it was not.  After playing just a small part of the song it would go  onto the next song even though the first one wasn't done.  Example: the  player says the song lasts 3:44 it ends at only 1:30 into the song.  I then  spent an hour talking with diamond over the phone and they told me it was a  dud. So I took it back after working with it for 5 hours.  The new one acts  the same way so I tried it on another computer and it plays the whole song  now but it still sounds like Rice Crispies.  The USB port is squirly and  causes the songs to have big glitches but the computer version of the mp3  has no problems the computer version should be identical to the rios  version.  This prouduct is just begging for a recall.  Be smart don't  invest in a rio till this one gets a recall.  	0
I've had the LifeDrive for a few weeks now and I absoulutely love it.  The complaints about load delays are way overblown.  It's not as snappy as the t5 but we are talking seconds here to swap between apps and as they get cached, there is no delay.    Pros Beautiful screen.  Not quite as bright as the 650 but much  brighter than the t3.  The color is better too.  Built in Wifi is easy to configure and along with the browser is very fast.  PocketTunes works really well as an mp3 player.  Much better than the Real one from the t3  Versamail is a good email app.  I do wish it would load office docs into docs to go though instead of using its viewer.  Drive mode makes it easy to walk up to any pc and transfer files at USB2 speeds.  Hardware button to toggle between landscape and portrait modes.  Battery life seems good.  It's not as good as a dedicated media player but this unit does a heck of a lot more.  I like the power slider where you can lock the unit to "Off".  i cant tell you how many times i've taken my t3 out of the bag and it was on.  Cons The mp3 player skips in the background when loading off the hard drive.  I hope that PalmOne can fix this with a patch.  The video player should play a wider variety of formats and palm should provide software to convert a DVD to mpeg at the lifedrive screen size.  I wish pocketTunes would play unproteted AAC files.  It's a nice codec and much leaner than mp3.  for ~500 they shoulkd have just put 64mb of NVRAM in the unit instead of reserving a portion of the hd for storage.  Would have made the battery last a lot longer.  There are a few minor warts but overall i'd say it's a terrific first attempt.  Five stars for breaking new ground with a convergent device and getting it mostly right.  	1
Like ther other cases my DJ 20 lasted only one year ans to quote Dell rep. "Your DJ has died and cannot be repaired" you can buy a replacement for $150.00. Sad thing is that it was the SECOND Dj that they had sent me that died and it froze up like the other ones you have read about. These units have a manufactures defect..don't buy them, like other Dell products ...junk.  	0
Foolish me, I just followed Apple's invitation a few weeks ago to buy their 80 GB iPod classic in flashy, greasy, view-all-fingerprints black finish. What I paid for that meager package (not even including a decent power supply for the wall outlet included, not colormatching white USB cable and white earphones!), was way much than their new classic models. And now this! Apple is fooling us with dumping prices of iPhones and iPods much lower than they offered just a few weeks as "special offer". Yes, their offers are special, but in a manner that I will probably never ever buy an Apple product again. Foul Apple.   BTW: Guess, the new iPod 160GB features a bigger, more power-consuming hard disk drive. So: more memory, less running time (about 8 hours less compared to the 80 GB model), and of course no way to replace the battery yourself?   	0
I don't like iPod's. I think that they're a total rip off. You buy an iPod for like $200.00, then you have to buy your charger, then you have to buy your headphones. Plus you have to pay for the songs you download on it. Thats what blew me away. I think that since you payed about $300.00 for your iPod, they should atleast give you the songs for free. I would advise everyone to stay away from them if they want to save money...  	0
This is my second mp3 player and I love it. Before buying this one I had a Creative Micro Zen, which was amazing, but worked for only a month, then the headphone jack brake and since I didn't have the guarantee (in fact I bought it in Canada and I live in Chile) I just sold it by pieces. Then I made an extensive research and I realized that-of the people I know-the ones with Sony mp3 players were the happiest, in fact they were more satisfied than the people who owned iPods. So I bought this player.  The first thing I liked about it is the small size and weight (useful). Putting music on it it's easy too, eventhough transforming 100 mp3 songs into atrac3plus took me like 2 hours o__o. Anyways...the sound it's nice too, I have some big noise-cancelling Phillip headphones and the player works really nice with them. Oh, and a AAA battery last a lot(I bought the player on Xmas and I haven't change the battery since then...).  So if you're looking for a cheap player, try this one, it's the best choice =)  	1
I had this Mp3 player for 1-2 years before I got my Ipod Nano. I never found anything wrong with it, and for the price I still think it is more worth the value than an ipod. I always reccomend the Creative over the ipod to friends on a limited budget. Here are a few pros and cons that I have noticed.  Pros:  1. This thing is TINY. Easily fits in your pocket, but just big enough to feel it (so you know its still there).  2. Very durable (Especially with the case).  3. Good Sound, never had a problem with scratchy noises or anything.  4. Voice recording is really cool, saves as a WAV file that you can upload on your computer.  5. FM/AM radio has very good reception.  6. The software that comes with it is awesome. Click and drag ripping similar to itunes, but better in that you can convert WAV and other audio formats into Mp3s (Very helpful).  7. Great battery life (better than my iPod's)   Cons: 1. Small screen (but this isn't really a problem considering how small the whole thing is).  2. No playlists, you have to scroll through every single song to find the one you want. I found this a little tedious, but it wasn't that bad because you can go through each song in like 1/2 a second (although that is a problem when you have a couple hundred songs).   Those are the only two cons that I can think of. Oh, and my headphones were magnetic for some reason, I don't know if anyone else's are like that, but thats kindof cool. Overall, I think the pros definetly outweigh the cons, and I would say for the great price, its one of the best out there.  	1
IT is not that good as i expect from samsung products.  	0
This little player is just what we wanted. It recharges at the computer, so I am not buying batteries everyday. The download software is user friendly and my kids figured it out on their own. We are very satisfied with our Zen player and thinking of getting another.  	1
I don't think i can recommend this digital audio player (dap) enough.  Pros: Great size       Big screen       Sound quality and sound options       Customizable equalizer (7 band)       Visualizations while music is playing (i have yet to see another player do this and i don't know why not)       Scrolling and speed of it       Intuitive user interface nice looking GUI       Short cut buttons to get you to or back to the screen you want       Dedicated play/pause button works for the music currently playing while in other screens (this may not seem like a big deal but its a feature I have personally yet to see on another dap. Ususally the play/pause button doubles as the enter button as well, here they have seperated the two.)       Ease of music transfer       Features (music, games, photos, videos, text viewing, fm tuner, recording capabilities, on the go playlisting)       Can listen to music while using other features like looking at photos (not all photo capable players can do this)       This thing gets loud, real loud!       On the go playlisting!       I'm going to mention sound qaulity again because its so good!!!       Cons: The one major con is simply it's storage capacity. With all of the features listed you really need more memory.             Sometimes you can hear the system registering a button being pushed while music is playing.But this is very minor.             Screen resolution could be better             As with many players; no OGG Vorbis!!! But this is fixable with firmware upgrades and may already be available and I just don't know about it yet.      There are some cons I am overlooking on purpose because they are so common place nowadays, like proprietory usb, lack of accessories (really, 90% of the accessory market are for ipods anyway) crappy earbuds that come with the player (who actual uses those? Just save some money and stop including them dap companies!)...etc. And there are probably some cons i missed completey because i am so enamored by the sound qaulity. If the storage capacity is a real big problem with you, don't worry, Samsung is working on a 2 and 4 gig version with an intergrated camera (megapixels unknown). Lets just hope this gets released in America!!    One last note; my albums play in the correct order so I don't understand the complaint that they don't.    Well I hope that this will help. This is by no means comprehensive and I am drawing comparisons from digital audio players that I have personal experience with.  	1
this was my grandson's present last year from his Mom and Dad.  He loves it  	1
I won my Dell DJ (15GB version), so didn't pay anything for it. I've had it for a few years now and it's sadly obsolete - big and square and heavy....but it still holds more music than you'll listen to in six months, and the battery lasts 20 hours which is longer than some these days.  I use it mainly in the car, on flights, and at work.  I can plug the adapter into an inverter in the car for power, so for long road trips it is perfect.  It also works with Linux, which is a big plus for me.  	1
I wanted a nicely priced mp3 player to hook up to the stereo for my business. I have been very happy with the Toshiba Gigabeat. The buttons are easy to maneuver, which is important because different staff use it. When I want to update the playlist I play during business hours, I just bring it home, connect it to my rather slow and dated computer, select the files I want to transfer to the Gigabeat, and then wait awhile. Once I figured out the best way to transfer files via Windows Media Player, transferring files became a snap. I bought a cable to hook up to my stereo receiver, so simple for a non-techie like myself.  If you just need this for music, this is a good capacity mp3 player for the price. I've never had problems with it freezing or malfunctioning. The buttons sometimes seem to either not respond or are very "touchy", but usually they are easy to maneuver. The 40GB capacity is more than ample for my needs, but there are larger capacity models as well. I bought a silicone case for it which is nice because it gets bumped around a lot at work. I also have an FM transmitter in the car which works great with it when we take a rare vacation.   	1
This is a great system. I use it with my Amazon Unbox player and transfer digital videos.  Unbelieveable system, love it.  	1

I like this MP3 player. Its music quanlity is good and easy to use. But 128M is a little small. I should have bought the 256M version.  	1
I recently puchased the 512MB Muvo TX FM so I could listen to music while running. This model comes with an armband (some don't) and is great for the job. It took about 2 seconds to figure out. I simply plugged it into a USB port, copied some MP3s onto it and I was off.  Like anothe rreviewer mentioned, the earbuds aren't great, just OK.  	1
I bought the bean just before I had my first baby thinking it would be great to have in the hospital.  Boy was I wrong.  I brought it home and tried to install the software onto my computer.  The program kept canceling the installation process and when I went online to get the so called patch it did nothing to help me.  NONE of the music that I had PAID for and downloaded onto my computer were compatable with the SonicStage.  I became very frustrated and deleted the whole thing off my computer and returned it.  When I went to return it the lady told me that it sounded like I got a corrupt disc, which I bought her story and exchanged it for a new bean. Same thing happened, I couldn't get the program to complete the installation process and took the whole thing back AGAIN to Target.  Definately a waste of my time.  The player looks cute and is nice in your hand but definately not worth the hassle it has with it.  Don't waste your time in my opinion.  	0
Yes, its bigger and heavier than an IPod,  but its worth it.  Add to it that you can use WindowsMedia Player to load and sync  your files instead of that stupid ITunes crap.  So much more control over my files. Music (and more) just the way I want it, not the way that someone else thinks I  want it.  I wouldn't trade it for a hundred IPods.  	1
Great features, great construction, great concept.  What's wrong then?  Battery life is ABYSMAL.  I'm talking 30-40 minutes when the device was brand new and running on a full charge.  In my opinion it's pretty much unconscionable to ship a portable music player that isn't really portable for more than 30-40 minutes.  Even with the WiFi turned off it's not much better.  Contrast this to my 5th generation iPod (which the Sansa was intended to replace) which gets 13-20 hours per charge.  I never even worry if it's charged or not, it always just seems to have plenty of battery life.  I was excited to receive the Sansa Connect, even told all my friends about the concept of unlimited downloads.  Sadly I'm very disappointed with the product.  I don't think it's worth paying a subscription fee to Yahoo Music when the device isn't even portable -- I could just stream music for free if I wanted to be tied to only places with power available.  The other very bad thing about this product is that if you are already a Yahoo Music Jukebox user it's nearly impossible to get the software for the Sansa to work properly.  Unlike with an iPod where you just plug it in and it offers to transfer your songs, I had to uninstall, reinstall, delete songs, re-download songs, etc. etc.  It was a total nightmare.   Also, if you don't sync it frequently enough it gets screwed up and you have to reload everything.  Yahoo offers no helpful tech support either.  I'm someone who loves the concept of DRM'ed subscription music.  I don't like the idea that I need to back up my iTunes library, and was looking forward to switching to this device.  Sadly it is no substitute and I regret buying it.  	0
FIRST OF ALL THIS DOES NOT COME WITH A NECKSTRAP!!! There is a misprint above, it comes with an armband - not a neckstrap. I was aware of this so it's fine with me but thought I would warn others.   In regards to the product itself I read all the professional reviews and this was basically tied with the ipod shuffle for best sound quality in the flash player category. If you are an audiophile looking for perfect sound you should get something more robust, because the sound in these small players can be slightly muddy. How to correct this? As with all portable players you need to toss the headphones that come with it. The Creative headphones are average and aren't really made to stay in the ear during workouts or running. If you are considering purchasing an ipod shuffle they will tell you the same thing - default headphones are always cheap. There's a huge difference in sound quality if you upgrade them to something better so it's highly recommended you do this.   I bought the Sennheiser PMX 70 headphones for this purpose. They sound great and stay in place while running. For walking around or light house-work I also bought the Sennheiser PX 100's which have even better sound and are more comfortable for longer use.   The armband that comes with this is great and you don't have to pay extra for it like you would with an ipod. I also own an older 256mb version of this product. It received alot of abuse but still works fine. It also comes with a rubber housing so if you bang your arm against the wall it won't break. Operating the unit is a no brainer, you just attach the USB cable to the player and your computer. It then acts as a hard drive which Windows will automatically read. A little window will pop up asking if you want to open files in the removal disk. Then, all you have to do is drag and drop your MP3 files and you are set. It comes with a CD with software but it's not really necessary. The software does have an owners manual that is much better than the written documentation that comes in the box so you may want to install it anyway.   A prior reviewer complained you could not put songs in folders. This is not true. You can organize your songs in folders on your computer then simply drop them into the player. When you want to change folders during use just press in the wheel and select "skip folder." You can then rotate the wheel to the folder you want. There are many options available, for example you can set it to play random songs or you can play them in order. If you like to play folders in order you may want to put a number in front of each folder or it will play them in alphabetical order.   There are several equilizer presets such as classical, jazz, rock, or custom. I set mine to normal because I read that you lose a little sound quality to distortion if you use a preset. Battery life is good, I didn't count the hours of use but it lasted quite a long time and the batteries are small and cheap so is not a large concern. I wish however the armband had a small slot in it to hold an extra battery. It's a bummer to run out of juice while on the trail or in the gym but that's a picky complaint.   There are other goodies as well such as FM radio, microphone to record voice and even mp3 encoding capability but I have not tried them out. I only use as an mp3 player.   The bottom line is that if you are looking for a player to take with you to the gym then look no further. It has good sound, good battery life, good options, good armband, and is easy to use. What more do you want?    	1
I didn't like this at all...it is really hard to use, has confusing operations, it feels really cheap, and the picture quality leaves ALOT to be desired.  Stay away from this one...  	0
The manual included with this device is completely useless. Go to the manufacturer's website and download an updated version - you'll be saving yourself a big headache.  The included manual reads like it was written by a non-English speaking third grader.  Example: "The keys will locked automatically, in the status without any operation and over the system keylock time."  Huh?  "Solution of unlock: Press 'Next' key and then press 'Last' key to unlock"  Needless to say, there is no 'Next' key.  Nor is there a 'Last' key.  REAL helpful directions there, guys.  I'm an IT professional who solves technology problems for a living, and I had a heck of time figuring this thing out.  Unless you're really into puzzles, I'd recommend spending a few more bucks on something that has usable instructions.  Please note that at least one of the people praising this comes right out and admits he doesn't own it - he owns a completely different model.  I'd take a "review" from someone who doesn't even own the product with a big grain of salt.  	0
I travel weekly via plane, and have had some sort of PDA /MP3 type device since 2000.  I started with Creative's Nomad Jukebox, 40 gig, CD PLayer sized device at about 10 oz., and for the last few years have had a Creative Zen X-tra 30 gig.  I'm a bit older, and frankly am tired of looking at a microscopic LCD screen, that you can hardly see.  Also Album Art is important to me, because frequently if I see an Album I'm interested in, I can't remember sometimes if I have it or not by looking at the song, as much as the graphic; also Titles like #1's, and Greatest Hits all start looking the same.  There's psychology for me in being able to look at the Album Cover! From what I read folks buy the Archos for video playing and recording, not primarily for MP3s; and not for carrying while jogging.  I bought it after reading all the other reviews primarily to hold my MP3 collection on a bright screen and display album art. First of all I've used it now about 3 weeks and the device is flawless!!!  I spent easily 30 hours though re-organizing my MP3 album collection, cleaning up duplicates, re-ripping CD's that software applied the wrong tags too, or put in Unknown albums.  I bought Tag and Rename online to help me do this; and in cases where it couldn't find album art, I did a google search and found jpeg covers, saved them and added them to the tags. I tried to load my newly cleaned-up collection to my Zen Xtra and found that WindowsMediaPlayer10, created duplicate libraries.  Afraid to corrupt my Archos, I transferred the library manually to the Archos putting it in HardDrive mode.  Since doing this I have grown to love HradDrive mode to manage the data on the Archos and my laptop and home PCs.  It is so easy to drag and drop and don't have to worry about synch issues.  I even talked to Archos Tech support, and the rep I talked to said he doesn't use Windows Media Player to synch, does it manual too. As one reviewer wrote the navigation buttons are not quite intuitive; but after about 2 weeks of working with the Archos, I really appreciate their set-up over any other device I've worked with.  The bookmark function is great, and the resume feature I love.  The audio quality is right up there with Creative's; and the screen is awesome.  The overall quality of the hardware is a good 4 stars, 5 stars would be something really rugged for me. The little tiny speaker that plays music is not great, but not bad to let you hear something in a pinch; like test a song, etc, or listen to a movie privately.  I use either Sennheiser headphones or Bose. When the track plays, it displays the album art, but not as you page through the music list.  But at least I can find the cover and get to know what I have. Now video.  I told you already I bought this to be a great MP3 player, not video; but anything I got with video for me was a bonus.  Well I didn't realize that as a Personal Video Recorder it will record video, right from a source.  But for me with travelling, I don't want to have to carry another device, open my laptop in a tiny airline seat, or worry about my battery dying.  Also I didn't want to take the time to record a DVD from a DVD player to play on the Archos.  For me it's easier to rip a video if I could.  I don't condone illegal sharing, but making a copy for myself, of movies that if they weren't portable, I'd never find time to watch; is legal as far as I'm concerned.  While Archos won't sell or support this, I bought an IM TOO DVD ripper package on the web, and am trialing DVDIdle's CSS and Region free.  I have successfully ripped about 4 movies, including Chronicles of Narnia.  There's some slight choppiness in the ripped movies, which are probably a techinical issue, because they are slightly choppy or hesitate a tiny bit, on my laptop ripped or the Archos, unrelated to the Archos.  But not enough to really effect playability.  Anyway the movies for me are AWESOME on the ARCHOS.  Picture quality is bright, audio is great; and action flows nice except for what I noted.  The side angle viewing is not bad.  The device performs really well; is very pleasing to work with and operate.  I'm considering buying an extended warranty in the next week.  I've had some of these warranties before for other products, and if you ever get a ding on the device, they probbably won't repair it, because they'll say you caused the damage; even when you didn't.  But for 29.99 for 2 years I think it's worth a shot.  Archos Tech support said they get calls about the devices freezing-up, but then those are the only calls they get? so how many really do? They told me to keep the unit backed-up so if I have to re-format I could. Also, as you can use the device USB Media Player or as a USB hard drive; Archos is very specific about telling you that if you have it in USB mode, you can "just" disconnect it; but if it's hard drive mode, do a safely remove hardware in windows before disconnecting.  Well because I have it plugged into the USB port, I forgot several times, and pulled it out, in hard drive mode w/o doing the safely remove.  So I taped a tiny note right on the USB plug, and was able to break the USB pull habit, and have always done the safely remove.  As I said I just love the convenience on any computer recognizing this as a HardDrive.  I've just started putting photos on it, and some personal movies, and getting all this in one small device; makes this worth it.  This is certainly an expensive item, but for weekly travel and portability, and being able to see a screen!!!, it's nice home away from home!  	1
I've had my C140 for a few months now with no problems - no distortion issues no trouble moving files to it.  HOWEVER, with doing absolutely nothing to it, my C140 is now frozen.  I can power it off but it's as if the hold button is on.  I can't forward to the next track, reverse to the last track - play and pause do nothing...  It's stuck at 1:06 of the last song I played.  It's toast...  	0
I have one buy from bestbuy at end of 2005, one month later I found when conect to computer the mp3 automaticly recharge and remember it. One year after the battery only can use about two hours, two years after very defecult to use it and almost all time conect to the charge.  	0
Works great, but drains battery life rather quickly I think. Very handy to have around when you need a usb flash drive.  	1
I began to love this item for about 4 months..I researched up everyone else's reviews and such to check on faults and other cons about it. I found none...until One day my archos's battery died completely...I even tried another spare power cable then...it just never came back on...so I sent in my player to archos support not too long ago...and hopefully they've fixed all the problems with it...   Other than the battery problem...the player was the best electronical deveice I owned...I had over 100 videos on there and 3 thousand songs...it pretty much consumed my life...  	1
hi from what I see the ipod nano has great durabiulty great sound and lots of other things.I do not have one but I hope I will be getting one for my bar mitzva.My friend has it.It is so cool.Good jod apple  	1

My wife uses her Rio Carbon all the time and she loves it.                                                     B. Holmes  	1
I received the Micro as a gift after suggesting it to someone else.  I'd done a *lot* of research on MP3 players, and this one fit exactly what was needed--small, flash-storage, not too expensive, good quality.  After playing with it, I have to admit the research paid off.  The sound is great, the controls are easy to use, there are lots of options, the accessories are just what you need and the price is nice for how much they packed into it.    To answer the biggest questions I had before getting one....The FM works.  In fact, my wife seems to think it works better than her car stereo.  We had no problem picking up a radio station 70+ miles away (of course, that's in flat ND).  The included software does rip CDs without a problem, though the method for transferring previously stored MP3 is rather awkward.  It does *NOT* accept songs directly from iTunes.  You'll need to be...creative...to get that to work (iTunes downloads in MP4 and protects the file).  The thing is tiny and can go pretty much anywhere.  The protective case is a frosted white material (plastic/rubber/silicone) and covers most of what you want covered, but none of what you don't want covered.  Line-in and microphone are there and work, but aren't exceptional.  The earbuds sound okay, but are pretty big and will probably need to be swapped out.  Oh, and the dark blue version is a nice navy color.  The only things I'd consider changing (beyond the size of the buds) are giving it a replaceable USB-rechargable battery and making the volume buttons feel just a bit more solid.  Really not much of an issue though.  If I was going to buy another MP3 player for this price, there's no doubt I'd buy this one again.  Only thing better would be a 1GB version.  (Mine will be moving around alot, so I don't want a non-solid-state (iPod-type) player.)  	1
I love this MP3 player.  The reason I picked this MP3 player over all the others is because it is small and it has an FM Tuner.  In the winter when I have to exercise inside the gym has televisions with FM transmitters to listen to them.  If I didn't have the FM tuner I would be able to listen to the televisions and it gets old after a while if you can only listen to straight music.  It is also nice to listen to a local station to get the local news and events that are going on.  The only downfall on this item is the display is difficult to see out in the sun.  Battery life is super long and it charges up fast if you forget to charge it up.  It really does last 3 hours with a 3 minute charge.    	1
So after a year of owning one, my iRiver H10 was stolen from me a week ago from my workplace. Currently I am in the market of looking for a new mp3 player, so I thought while I was at it I'd give a review of my 'ol grey  The Good:   Comes with tons of extra excessories that you cant get with the iPod. Built in FM tuner, voice recorder, text viewer, and a browser that easily lets you access any of these in a second.  Colorful screen and sleek look make it a very attractive player. The size never once bothered me, in fact it was perfect  Personal preference I know, but I way prefer the up-down scroll over the circle. It's way easier to go from track to track. As well the buttons on the side make it easy to go from track to track even if its in your pocket.    The Bad:  Viewing the mp3's through windows was excruciatingly slow, but mainly because I almost had mine completely full. Still though, if other people have said the same thing, then I guess it wasn't only mine...  After a while of having all my albums on my mp3 player, I one day turned it on to find that it had reversed all the track orders. I took off all the songs and put them back on, which temporarily fixed it, but after a while it did the same thing. I soon realized that it was in fact listing the songs in order of most recently played. I tried to find a solution to the problem, but with no luck. And don't let other people fool you. I checked the ID3 tags a million times and they were numbered correctly, and should've been in correct order. I just don't know why it did that!  I also found that the random fuction was a bit weird. I kept on hearing the same songs over and over again. After a long time I realized that it was randomizing only within a few letters. So if I had started off with a song that started with an A, then it only would've played the songs with the letters A, B, or C in the beginning. If I got tired of the ABC songs, I'd have to scroll down to F or G, or wayyy down to M or N. This got pretty frustrating, but I don't know if this was only my player, and I'm  fairly certain there was no feature on the player that made it this way.    So all in all, it was a great player for me. It got me through some boring lectures and lengthy bus rides. I'll miss the hell out of it, but I don't think I'll buy it again. The random function pissed me off too much, and I'm big into music, so I like to know what album a song is off of when I'm listening to it, which the iRiver does not do. The wrong album order didn't bother me too much after a while, but mainly cause I listen to it on random pretty much all the time. Even though I wouldn't buy it again doesn't mean I would not reccommend it though. However I do realize that I am biased against iPods, but why would you want to run out a buy something that everybody else has? There are better alternatives, and I do believe this is one of them!  	1
This is a great item, liek a mini tivo for on the go people, recoreds from tv, computer, dvd directly, awesome item.....  	1
I was looking for an inexpensive MP3 player for when I go to the gym or beach.  Something that if I dropped it in the parking lot I wouldn't be heartbroken or bankrupt over the loss.  This was the player for me.  What they didn't tell you is that the software and Windows XP don't play well together.  I tried downloading different drivers and such from their website.  I just made a bigger mess than I had before.  Long and short...I had to borrow a friends computer running Windows Me to get things to work.  Once it did, I loved my little gadget.  It was just a long process to get there.  	0
The screen tells me "memory error."  No one at Sony Tech Help can tell me why. One "analyst" actually suggested that I plug it into a friend's computer and see if it works, since it no longer works on mine.  I've had an Ipod for two months and it works great. This Sony has never been much and now it doesn't work at all and no one knows why!  I'm actually amazed by the stupidity of the whole thing.  	0
Creatives new Zen micro is a promising mp3 player for people of all ages. It seems to be the only mini-drive player that can compete with the iPod mini. Compared to the mini, heres are the pros and cons:   Pros-Removable battery, Better battery life, Ten electrifying colors(5 more than the mini), Intuitive vertical Touch Pad, Mesmerizing blue glow, FM radio with recording, Voice recording and built in mic, Twice the internet music access(including Napster, MSN's music service and more), Comes with everything you need (A belt clip that doubles as a stand, a protective carrying case, a USB 2.0 cable, a universal AC adapter and in-ear dynamic bass response earbuds)  Cons-Even though it hold more songs than the iPod mini,5gb may not be enough storage for a growing music library, Does not have games which should not be an issue for most people, Not as many accessory options from brands other than Creative (but hey, it comes with everything you'll ever need, except the optional wired remote which i will be getting once i get mine)  All in all, this is a solid player for many users from the begginer to the audiophile  yes..i will be getting one, the Pros substantially outnumber the cons. This is the player ive been looking for.  	1
When I first bought this device it was for the FM recording capabilities. When trying to record stuff off of the radio, the instructions were pretty simple. Once finished my recording I listened to it back and the sound was VERY distorted and it skipped alot as if it was a CD player with no anti skip feature. If SanDisk is going to advertise this feature they should atleast make sure that it functions half-way decent. I was very dissapointed in this player  	0
I have an iPod Photo that I got before the Video came out. I woudl definetly splurge the extra money to get a video. The Photo is clumky and has a very small screen. It is hard to find hardware and accessories for it because they don't make it anymore. I would definetely advise to NOT buy this product. Used ones can be good if they come at a good price. But I would not buy it for full price.   	0
RCA had a good idea but a bad design. The Software is like trying to find your way through a maze that has no exit. I was a system network engineer and I was ready to bounce it off the walls a few times. The clip broke when trying to ugrade the firmware before we had a chance to use it. I had to call and order another clip which took over and hour. Save up and buy something better or go get a root canal it's less painfull.  	0
I finally got mine today and within 2 hours of playing around with it, the screen and front bezel already show many scratches!  My mini never scratched and my 3rd gen 20 gig didnt show scratches like these until after months of playing. There is obviously a problem with the coating that is applied to both the lcd and front bezel. I can only imagine how bad it will look in a couple of weeks :( Beware and stay away from the ipods until apple gets there stuff together and fixes this problem!   	0
I felt compelled to write a review on this MP3 player because it's just getting trashed by the public. I like most people own a Samsung cell phone & think the company produces very good products. I have an iPod & decided to get this MP3 Player because I was getting bored of my iPod. Samsung MP3 Players have been getting the worst reviews on Amazon.Com for its horrible software. Yes! It's true the software provided is horrible only for 1 reason. It's a great program except that once you rip your music from your CD's that it just doesn't transfer over to the player properly (Actually doesn't transfer at all). The program just won't recognize the Samsung player & so in return won't transfer what you just ripped from the CD. I called Samsung at the 1800 number & they said that it's been known to happen with this player that the software just won't recognize the player & that they will contact me in the future when they find a way to fix the bug. So the only way for you to transfer songs over is to use WMP (Windows Media Player). WMP is fine but it does take a tad bit long for the transfer completion & a bit tricky. I feel the Napster software provided is for COMPUTER experts & not for someone like me who just uses the computer to go AOL to chat & check emails. All in all it's not a horrible player, but would be GREAT if the software provided actually works. You can only use the program to RIP music & keep it on your computer as a Jukebox player. I give it 4 stars. I guess I'm being generous.     	1
Unfortunately my 4G iPod photo that I was very happy with was lost/stolen.  This led me to buy the 5G video product soon after it was released.  I bought it as a music player first and foremost, with the video as an after thought, assuming I would rarely if ever use it.  After 5 weeks of ownership, I am very pleased. - Considering the 60GB size, I was happy that this was still smaller and lighter than the 30GB 4G.  - I have been nervous about the screen scratching and have been looking for a better case than what was in the package...but so far not even a minor scratch. - Had no expectations for the video, but the quality is excellent considering the screen size.  Watched an episode of Lost on a plane (irony) and found after taking a moment for my eyes to adjust to the size, that it was really easy to see and the size posed no problems.  It's been fun to download some free trailers and so forth...but still overall, the video seems like something I will only use in the air. - Sound seems slightly better than the 4G, but I do not have a great ear, so it's barely noticeable.  Battery life is definately a concern if you plan on using it for video, but the 40% more batter life for the 60GB versus the 30GB was worth the additional $ to me.  The exclusion of the AC charger is dissapointing and would pose a problem for those who travel without a laptop.  Thankfully, I didn't lose that on my old one, so I'm set, but others should take note.  Well, I wish I didn't lose my 4G and could have waited for a few more upgrades in the product, but considering my expectations I am a happy camper.  As the title says, a great music player, with massive storage and good sound, with the added bonus of a quality video playback device with a vivid picture making up for the size of the screen.       	1
Pros: mp3/wma playback, size<br>Cons: intermittent connectivity to PC, battery drain problem, loose LCD display, flimsy back cover<p>This player's specs looks nice at first: mp3 and WMA playback, 32mb upgradeable to 96mb, small size so you don't look like techno-dork, and I only paid $30 for it on Black Friday. Sound quality is good after ditching the supplied headphones and the LCD is nice.<p>But...<p>Even after the latest firmware upgrade, the battery discharges even when turned off - I'm lucky to get a few days worth out of it [only using it 1 hour/day]. <br>The back case is a bit flimsy and looks like it'll break off any day due to the constant changing of the battery. <br>Default software had problems connecting to Win98, Win2k, and WinXP - had to get the original Rioport with Nike PSA drivers...then use compatibility mode in Win2k and XP to trick it into working.<br>Default software makes it a pain to transfer songs to the unit: only exception is if ALL your MP3s have ID2 info PROPERLY entered.<br>The LCD hangs separately from the unit so it's easy to get it tangled onto anything.<p>Bottom line: not worth even the $30 I paid for it.  	0
I got one of these for Christmas, and I didn't even get to listen to a single song. The user-interface for the FM tuner did not work very well, so I followed the manual's instructions to do a firmware upgrade. I formatted as per the manual, and now the player is dead. Complete waste of money IMHO.  	0
I have heard a lot about these things freezing up and dying, but thats only because something was installed wrong on it.  i have had mine for 3 years now, and it only died once, because i downloaded free solitaire games off the internet.  i reset it, and it works fine.  so convenient to be able to edit all of my microsoft office applications on the go.  i went to hawaii and took this with me, and was able to use the moblie manager feature to upload my digital cameras sd card onto it, so i could continue to take pictures.  the mp3 player has always worked perfectly for me.  the interent applications are fantastic.    	1
Its fundamentally wonderful device squeezing in lots of features in its cute n tiny shape. I didn't see any player as compact as this. Only con I find is the price, probably the highest among its peers.  	1
Excellent! Fast service, good price and ONLY $5.00 Shipping by UPS ground from Colorado to California (do not "eat" the cost of Shipping & Handling like many others!) Thank You  	1
I bought this unit when it was so much more pricey.  I used it for  a little while and then the usb connection was broken or without making contact.  I sent the unit in for repairs and it came back fixed but to it was broken again a few weeks after.   Worthless piece of equipmment.   	0
I did my research before purchasing this item... looking for something within a hundred bucks(preferably) and something that had great reviews.  I narrowed it down to a few MP3's, and both my daughters prefered the zen nano plus 512.  It arrived quickly, and its been a week since they received it and they LOVE it! The sound is great, to get songs in there is easy and fast, and functions are simple. I fully recommend this to anyone shopping for an affordable mini MP3 player.  	1
I got a Green iPod mini for my birthday in July 2005. I loved the easy to use clickwheel, and the shiny green color. But around October of that year, it started to have glitches and it would freeze up after being on for only 2 minutes! I took it to Apple and they gave me a new one because of a problem. Then in February 2006, the replacement mini died. It wasn't recognized on iTunes, and it finally showed the sad iPod icon. I put it in Diagnostic Mode (Press Select and Previous) and I did a HDD scan. The scan failed and when I reset it, it turned on to the sad iPod again and the hard drive started clicking and it sounded like it was abour to explode. I went to Apple again and they gave me another one. When I got home (thankfully Apple store only 15 minutes away from me) I charged it, and it worked fine. Now it's February 2007, and the warranty expired today. When I turned it on when I woke up, it wouldn't turn on.   What a waste of time. This is the most UNRELIABLE iPod out there. And Apple says they can only repair it for a fee of $[...]. That's how much I paid for it in the beginning! I'm just going to buy a new iPod nano.  	0
I purchased one and received it, it never worked right.  I received a replacement and have had the same problem.  I think this model is a waste of money unless they fix the bugs.  It just keeps saying you have to repair the disk with software that does not come with it.  	0
I owned my Zen Nano Plus for 13 months before it stopped working.  The LCD will still light up for a few seconds after I try to power up, then it shuts down.  My computer won't recognize it, so I can't update firmware.  Since I'm 13 months out, I can't get any support from Creative, except for paying $13.  I'm going to buy a different, cheaper brand.  I dont expect things to last forever, but 13 months?  C'mon.  	0
I REALLY wanted to keep this unit.  The AV700 is a class act.  I liked everything about the unit itself--build quality was excellent, as was the screen.  The interface was a little klunky (compared to an iPod, for example), but was not a significant factor.  However, I returned it.  Why? In short, I could not get the AV700 to work with my TV system.  First of all, and most importantly, the supplied cables are very short--I think they're 3 feet long, if that.  Even though all my components are in a cabinet, the cables weren't long enough.  And, because they are special cables, I couldn't just go to Radio Shack and buy longer ones.  I think this is quite "short-sighted" (excuse the pun).  The cables should be at least 6 feet long for almost any current television equipment installation.  So, the AV700 was pretty much dead in the water for me, just based on the cable length (I also have to include the dock cable in the indictment.  I think it's less than a foot long and protrudes from one side and inflexible so as to severely limit installment options.) Second, the instructions were quite general and, for a video novice like me, inadequate.  There were no more comprehensive instructions on the Archos website either.  I've been around computers for many years, but haven't done much in the way of multimedia setup.  I looked at my installation and tried to follow the instructions as best as I could, but I never got video to the AV700.  I am sure that a video-savvy person wouldn't have experienced this.  However, I would caution a potential buyer who doesn't have such experience to expect difficulty with installation. So, quite reluctantly, I returned the unit.  I really wanted it to work.  Archos could remedy the situation with longer cables and better instructions--either in print or on the website.  Until then, I would advise caution before purchasing the AV700.  	0
I bought this device to get clips off of the radio, the FM reception and sound is very good, however this device falls flat on it's face when it records the FM to a low quality WAV type file.  Is this some kind of FM copy protection ploy?  Whatever it is, it sucks, and I am going to once again have to look elsewhere, but there doesn't appear to be any device yet that has great FM reception coupled with great FM MP3 recording, except a multimedia PC.  If anyone knows of one, please let me know?   	0
I purchased the Sony Walkman 512 For my 18 year old granddaughter for her graduation, she loves it ,she also jogs everyday and say it has great sound Quality ,also she has downloaded  her music with no promblems.  We rate it a 5 star. Theresa in Mandeville La.  	1
This is a great mp3 player for the money.  I have purchased creative mp3 players before and continue to be impressed. I suggest transferring songs to the mp3 player through windows explorer and not the software that is given through creative.  You can just copy and past songs like using a dongle(travel drive).  	1
I received this item in a very timely manner, although when I opened it up the face part where the songs would display has been damaged. looks like it might have been heat damage of some sort, the display will not work.  	0
I bought a 5 GB RIO Carbon about 2 years ago.  After one year the volume knob broke, so I returned it, paid $100 and got a replacement.  About 2 months later the replacement died, so I paid another $100 and got another replacement.  Now the third replacement volume knob broke (without any dropping etc.)  I wish I never bought a RIO.  It has a serious design flaw.  Buy an MP3 player with no moving parts.  I should have bought an Ipod, as I have now spent far too much money continuously repairing/replacing my RIO.  Also not there is no shuffle mode on it either which would have been a nice feature.  	0
I bought my son this player for christmas he is only seven so I didnt want to get him an ipod and have him lose it get it stolen or destroy it so I went with this. Great move. It was a bargain price I thought it would be low quality but it has held up great. He uses it every day and it is very simple to use. I am definetly a pleased buyer.  	1
my daughter and her 2 cousins rec'd this mp3 player for christmas 2005. they are still working and the battery life is incredible. i decided to get one for mothers day, so i bought this one again but with more memory. i absolutely love it and it is very easy to put the songs on it. there is some skipping now and then when it plays but it is nothing bothersome. i did buy different headphones but that was a personal comfort thing. i really think for the price it is a great value. i love the shape of it too, it fits comfortably in your pocket.   	1
Unfortunetaly, its only 1 geabyte but if it had a better memory, it would be better than the piece of **** that is the iPod Nano. Highly Recommended!  	1
I Love this thing! Had it for over a year now. It pretty much did what I needed it for. Totally portable fits in my hand. Shaped as a cute bean. The size of the mp3 player was rather convenient for me. I just stuff it in my pocket and there it stays. I also like the built in USB. College student, so whenever I am running low on batteries I could always recharge it at a computer. Super fast charge as well, 3 minute charge gave me about 3 hours of music play. Fully charged it lasted for days. I listen to this thing everyday usually in 2 weeks I need to recharge it again. I also like the ear buds that came with it. Asymmetrical cord allowed me to have the ear buds around my neck instead of putting them away all the time. Pretty nice I recommend this to people that are on the go and want something super light.  Holds a nice amount of music.    Downside is the program that comes with it. Converts all the mp3s to an Ogg file. Its a bit annoying. I use this program only to transfer songs onto the mp3 player other then that I don't use it.   	1
About a month ago I bought the ipod 60gig photo with all the accessories; this set me back over five hundred bucks. I bought it because everyone told me it was the best on the market. I must congratulate Apple on making a piece of garbage! Plain and simple. Couple with iTunes and I rest my case. Today I bought the Samsung YH-925GS. I Love it. Clear crisp sound, no distortion at high levels, SRS and WOW capabilities, all of which Apple have omitted from their gadget. Don't believe what the manual that came with the Samsung about having to use Napster to transfer music, you can use Windows Media 10 and Musicmatch, the latter being the simplest! One criticsm. I use, or am trying to use Napster to Go. But right now the unit does not support it and Napster are waiting for a firmware update. Nothing on the box to indicate this, nothing on the website. Apart from that....flawless...buy one!   	1
I own a dj 15gb which I had now for approximately three years.  I love it. I read the reviews that the player will not support playforsure audio.  This is totally incorrect.  I download music from Walmart and all their music is in the playforsure format. I never had a problem using MusicMatch to download audio onto my dj.  The dj controls are easy to navigate. My only compliant is that there is no review button.  The sound is superb, I suggest you purchase KOSS Stereo In Ear Ear Plugs. I previously owned a RCA Lyra which had a FM transmitter.  It was a waste of money, because I never listened to FM. What is the purpose of a FM transmitter when you have your own music to listen to? I would never consider owning an ipod, for all my downloaded music is in the playforsure format, which ipod definitely does not support.  Sony ipod is a rip off, because it does not allow you to use any other format, except itunes.  An ipod is NOT the best or economically audio player. It is only a popular audio player.  	1
Like many reviewers, I really wanted to like this product. The price/performance looked just right. When I bought it late last year, there were enough reviews that I knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal, but it sounded like a fair tradeoff. <p>Boy was I wrong. Reading the reviews, it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it. That's been my experience.<p>If I'd been paying attention, I would have noticed the 3 month warranty. But I didn't because I'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty. Now I know better. I've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose. A $300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack? So now I've got to call their customer &quot;service&quot; (of course, no 800 number) to send the thing back. <p>From the other reviews I've read, it sounds like that won't be the end of my troubles. I fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because, as other reviewers have pointed out, the construction is pretty flimsy.<p>Now let's talk about the software. Like other reviewers, installation was hell. Subsequent behavior even worse. About 10% of the time it can't find the device when I attach it to my PC. After I had it a couple weeks, it got into a state where it could never find the device, no matter how often I rebooted my PC, reset the device, reloaded drivers, etc, etc. Creative's online support was no help at all. In fact, I'd have to rate it among the worst I've ever encountered. <p>Finally, I uninstalled and reinstalled the software, the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing. To my amazement, even that process was error-prone. It took several days of attempts before things finally &quot;worked&quot; again and I haven't a clue why. That doesn't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability.<p>I did buy the Notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement. But that's a moot point now. My gut tells me the Nomad will in the long run be, at best, a 40GB portable hard drive, albeit one on which I can't create folders, or, at worst, a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again (I have their Audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating). My gut tells me I'll also end up buying an iPod. Which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars, I'll end up spending more than twice that. <p>Be forewarned. I would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks, depending on how mad I felt about the crummy software. Now, even 1 star seems like I'm giving Creative the benefit of the doubt.  	0
I've owned a number of other MP3 players and have made a concerted effort to avoid "iPod madness."  But with the recent price drop and upgrade of the battery life, I decided to take the plunge.  I bought mine through the Apple store and got free engraving as well as free shipping.  All-in-all, I LOVE my new 4gb iPod mini.  I also like that I can import my MusicMatch Jukebox playlists into iTunes rather easily.  There are really, in my opinion, only a few negatives:  ~ Dock is no longer included.  However, the included USB cable works fine IF you have a powered USB port on your PC. ~ The included ear-buds are AWFUL!  Fortunately I had several pairs of good headphones floating around, so that was not a big issue for me.  I would recommend picking up the USB power adapter and the Insten iPod Sync & Charging cradle.  I would also recommend checking out the iLounge web site for lots of good information on the care and feeding of your iPod.  Oh!  One other negative is that these things ARE addictive. And I'm kinda thinkin' now that should have gone for the 20gb version.  	1
This is my first mp3 player, I have to say it's been a good experience. With patience I figured out the program that came with it. (my biggest concern after reading reviews)The battery lasts forever and the sound is good, although I think I have noticed a skip or two lately, and the ear buds are painfull and short, get some new ones. I think this a good product for the price and does a good job.  	1
Ok, first of all, in response to a few of you who have 'reviewed' the Zen Micro already:  If there aren't many OGG players out there, there's probably a good reason for it. For some reason, 'Betamax' keeps ringing in my ears...  Second, no one, and I mean NO ONE, listens to AM radio. Unless you want to catch 'the game', or perhaps you're just grumpy because your cane has fallen behind the washing machine again and you can't reach it?  Third, if your girlfriend laughs at you, tell her where to shove it. Strap on a pair man. If anything you should feel smug for owning a quality piece of intriguing equipment.  As an iPod owner, I can say well done to creative for emulating apple's simplicity and sleek looks. I'd be interested.  	1
Recently purchased this item through Amazon Marketplace and I am stuck with something that doesn't work...I own the 512 mb version of this model and have used it for over a year without an issue...only use it for running because it is so small and clips easily to my waistband...this model has given me nothing but trouble since I took it out of the box 4 days ago...customer support has been a joke...if they tell me to download the firmware one more time....did it and still not working...won't play past the third song without shutting down or simply just stops playing any music at all...won't shuffle..keeps going back to the first song...waste of money.  Keep shopping for something else or just be sure that you can get your money back when it does not work properly!!!  	0
I thought this product had a great price and excellent features, and when it worked it was actually pretty excellent.  My complaint though, was that it crashed very frequently. With each firmware upgrade things sometimes got better and sometimes got worse. I had to carry a paper clip with it so that I could reset it when this happened (which happened every day). The worst part of this is that it crashed most often when seeking, which I would want to do after the previous crash to get back to the part I was listening to. It was very frustrating.  Finally, a few days after the warranty expired the system simply ceased functioning. It won't turn on, no response from plugging into the computer, nothing. It's dead.  I was very sad to see it die, because I hoped they might eventually fix the crashing problem with firmware upgrades, and despite the crashing everything else was very good (good sound, pleasant interface, even had a line-in recording and built in microphone).  	0
I would give this 0 stars if i could. Don't waste your money on this product.  I bought this item last winter and the headphone jack recently stopped working.  I sent RCA the player for a replacement.  Let me tell you that the people that work there are incompetent.  They first said that I would have to pay $69 for labor and that it would take 7-10 days for me to receive my replacement.  10 days went by and I called them back, and they said it had not yet shipped but that I should expect it shortly.  12 more days, now three weeks total, and I called them back and they told me that they had sent back the original to me because there was something wrong with the Serial number.  They said I should have received it, but I had not, and they had no idea why.  Three days later I called back and apparently what they told me before was a mistake and that they had not sent it back to me.  In addition, the mix-up was because the headphone-jack breaking was a KNOWN problem and therefore I would not have to pay the $69, but that it would take another 7-10 days.  12 days later, more than a month now, no replacement so I called back.  Apparently, its on back order, and they could not give a range for when I should get my replacement.  At this point, I no longer want to deal with this company so I ask for a refund, which takes 6-8 weeks.  I would rather wait to get the refund and buy a different product, especially since the headphone-jack was a KNOWN problem, which means it would probably happen again.  Do not waste your money on this device, you WILL regret it.  	0
I bought this NIKE player right when it came out.<br>I went from tape player to CD player to mini-disc player<br>to finally the NIKE mp3 player.<br>I use portable audio products when i go running or when<br>i workout at the gym lifting weights.<br>When I first bought the NIKE player, I thought it was<br>awesome...<br>1.  Doesn't skip (like all my previous portable audio<br>players)<br>2.  Comes with a belt strap for my arm for running and<br>a belt clip when i go lift weights.<br>3.  Easy software for mp3 and cd songs<br>etc, etc...<br>However, there are some major problems:<br>1.  the port where the remote control/headphone/and<br>USB connector plugs into broke within several months<br>2.  the plastic casing also broke after 6 months<br>3.  And the damn entire mp3 player is now on the<br>fritz and doesn't play sometimes when i turn the<br>thing on<p>I say buy a more durable, reliable mp3 player.<br>I recommend the Panasonic sdsv80....it's been<br>awesome so far.  	0
Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off.  It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist. Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones. AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something. I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s***.  	0
It is a nice little package - if you like small packages. The problem I have is the little toggle button in the front - They make it look like a dial in the pics - but do not be fooled it is a flimsy black toggle button. that is easily broken. The toggle is a two piece button that should not have been used.   Spend a little more and get the bigger Zen or IPod  	0
I have purchase this player in April because I went to a Wedding to California. It worked and when I bought in April and in May I came back and three (3) months later in July the battery is not holding so I had to call Lexar for a replacement and they did send me a replacement. I got the replacement in August and then guess what happen agian? YES the battery will not hold again. This is ridiculous. I mean the new one is a lemon and the EXCHANGE one is lemon too. Lexar makes cheap cheap cheap things except for memory. The shouldn't make MP3 Players anymore and just stick with making memory. Like the I-PODS and other manufactures who uses a built in rechargeable battery and when the battery dies your screwed. If they say pay $30-60 to replace a battery I rather buy a new MP3. If you get there extended service plans that is crazy you can even but a new one if you get there extended service. Think about about it when you're buying MP3 players. My suggestion is buy an MP3 player that uses batteries like for a walkman or rechargeable batteries for cameras because once they die you can get batteries at a CHEAPER price. I am going to REFUND my money for my player. Don't ever buy from LEXAR or any other compnies that uses built in rechargeable batteries.  Nothing good about this player.  Rechargeable batter (Built in) always dieing every three months. Think about it after the warranty is over what are you going to do with it. You're stuck.  	0
This is in the response to Benjamin's comment about the ipod encrypting cd's are mp3 you pull into itunes:  hey it doesn't have to "encrypt" the music you store on it. On my ipod i like to mess with the encoding settings to get a bit bettter quality (up to 320kpbs), but you can still go the standard route (192kbs) interchaing the AAC for the MP3 format: (no difference really apple says that AAC is a little better in conserving memory but the difference is too marginal to really matter)  Here's how:  Edit -> Preferences ->  Advanced -> Importing Tab -> Import using Mp3 encoder  That way when you do manage to pull out the music from your ipod using third party software you won't have to worry about the format not being compatible on another player.  	1
I love this player...it is replacing a previous one I lost.  I received the product in exactly the amount of time I was told.  It was in excellent condition containing everything the description said.  	1
Incredibly frustrating.  I was quite happy with my T30 until I recently upgraded my windows media player to version 11.  It became IMPOSSIBLE to add any new music.  There is a firmware upgrade on the iriver website, which I downloaded and installed three times.  It just doesn't work!  I managed to solve this problem only by rolling back to WMP 10.   BTW, I emailed iriver customer support about this problem and waited 17 days for a response.  	0
I would advise anyone looking to buy an MP3 player not to buy this one. I had one for just about a week before it started acting strange; it would randomly turn itself off and eventually I had to pop the battery out and put it back in to get the stupid thing to turn on. This things sucks up batteries at an unbelievable rate too. It uses 1 AAA battery and I would have to replace the (Duracell) battery EVERY OTHER DAY.   DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER!!!  	0
I have owned a total of six iRiver's over the years.  My first is a 40GB unit that has been going strong for over four years.  The next two were smaller 1GB units and although they are still working, my kids wanted more capacity so we bought two H10 20GB units.  They are going on two years old and haven't had one issue.  Lastly, I bought my wife a 30GB unit about 1 1/2 years ago and she's never had an issue with it.  The thing we like best about the IH series is that they are recognized by your PC's USB port as just another drive.  It couldn't be easier to manage your video and music files them simply using Windows Explorer to copy and past files to your iRiver.  Maybe I've been lucky or others have been unlucky but either way, I'd take these iRiver units over the ipods any day.  Apple has tried to control how you use the unit in order to boost their profits.  I like them but wouldn't take one over the iRiver's.  	1
Thank you for the great product and timely shipping. Great business and very responsive.  	1
I've used the iPod 60GB as a travel hard drive that I use to store digital images.  I found it to be very fast with the optional fire wire connection cable and very stable--it always works and had no difficulty taking 30 Gigs of images.  It's noiseless, had excellent design features, and is powered through the comptuer--another words 'invisible' when it should be.  I have no hesitation in recommending this product.  	1
I bought the iRiver T30 1GB after researching extensively, mostly based on the "plays for sure" feature. The idea is to be able to play all your legally bought, legally downloaded (from MSN Music) songs on a player that is compatible with the whole MSN system -- Windows Media Player, etc.  I was therefore extremely aggravated and disappointed when the T30 wouldn't play any of my MSN downloaded music, or even some other .WMA files.  I spent hours trying to "fix" the problem, then discovered via an online search that this is a KNOWN problem with the T30.  It sounds great.  I like everything about it -- except that I can't play all of my music on it.  Buyer Beware!  	0
Battery life is great, you really don't need to worry about charging this player. Menues are pretty easy to work with but the fact that there's no search option can sometimes make it somehow cumbersome to work with, try making playlists so you can find things easily.  	1
I've read all the reviews about how inconvenient it is to load music to this player using WMP and Napster. You don't have to go this route though.  This player will function as a drag and drop if you do two simple things. 1: Change the windows settings to show hidden files. Then click on the device and open the music folder in the device. You'll see all the songs you have loaded in there. From there just drag and drop all your new songs right in the folder.  2: After this is done use the utility suite that came with the player to 'rebuild your library'. In doing so, the software will have your device recognize all the music you just dragged and dropped into the player. It's a little easier than syncing.  As for the 4 stars rather than 5, well....as far as I can tell the napster program is the only way to create playlists for the player. This coupled with the lack of accessories and all the searchability issues when you begin to compile quite a bit of music on the player are far from ideal. However, I've owned one since about 3 weeks after it was released and I am very satisfied with it. Never had any problems at all.  Hopefully when they release a general firmware update to it they take some of these issues into consideration.  Also, apparently (though I've never checked it out myself) the Samsung Music Studio program works wonders with this player as well. If anyone has access to this software, I'd love to hear your take on it.  	1
We ordered this as a Christmas gift for our son. Thankfully we opened it so we could load music on it so he could use it right away. When we tried to load music, it would get stuck after every song. We would have to power it off and then try again. After 2 hours of trying we gave up and requested a refund!  	0
this video unit very swiftly followed on the heels of the photo ipod which clearly was aimed at maximising sales for folks who wanted to put digital photos/power point presentations etc on an ipod, presenting them with another three-four hundred photo/video unit after they'd just bought a threee-four hundred dollar unit. After barely three months the photo ipod is now effectively discontinued and being discounted. I initially got a 60 GB photo which I discovered is incompatible - its just too thick for the docking station -  with the new Altec Lansing IM 7 - after establishing said incompatibility with Apple (obviously Altec's fault - not Apple's) I discovered that the new 60GB (slightly thinner) video was just about to be launched so I swapped my photo for a video only to discover Apples cynical exploitation continues. I was very unimpressed with the video ipod, the screen would have scratched very quickly and does according to many reviews, unlike the photo which happily is more durable, there was no mains adapter, none of the peripherals I have like iTalk work, you have to buy the new universal dock at fourty dollars a pop to make some features work. The better (20 hours) battery life is only for the 60GB, another deliberate cynical ploy. The video/battery capability is seemingly  pretty limited as regards watching films longer than 100 mins or so. I dont really see the point of watching vacuous mtveee type music videos on such a small unit - but each to their own. As for the limited TV series drivel currently on the itunes PPV web site, enoough said!!   I originally had a 4th gen 40GB which was big enough for my 5000+ songs. Each time they update the ipod they take something away from the package. This time with the video they've taken virtually everything away, no dock, no adapter, no peripherals, and added the crappiest thinnest case you could imagine which wont really protect the unit long term. Unless very small screen video is really tremendously important to you and you're happy spending two dollars on each music video/populist tv shows thus far offered buy the photo ipod and save fifty dollars and get a much better deal with a screen that will not scratch so easily and wont be such a problem even if it does scratch up a bit. I use mine exclusively as a music/audio player and now have a second photo ipod after swapping out my new vidoe player. I found the video player took thirty mins or so longer to download the exact same number of songs that my photo ipods took.  And I can still record speech/memos etc on my ipod, use an fm transmitter on the car stereo. Its funny how generally speaking the media just lap up whatever apple do and never seem to criticise the (to me) cynical plethora of products, many of which if you have a reasonable music collection are worthless, 1GB or less of music recorded at at least 192kbs to ensure reasonable play back sound is to me a waste of money and effort. If you buy decent headphones - at the very least Shure E3's or better, owning a 60 GB ipod is an expensive toy. Doubtless Apple will sooner or later launch yet another expensive video ipod update, presumably enough folks will want the kudos of having the latest model so Apple's profits will continue. Hopefully if this cynical product exploitation continues increasingly folks will begin to see through this creeping corporate cynicism. I make this observation as a free market loving Republican. I suppose as a proud non gamer and older geezer, with nothing but contempt for the vacuous mtveee and its ilk this product is not really aimed at me.  My music ipod is still by far and away the finest and most cherished toy I have ever owned.   	0
In concurrence with the previous opinion given by the reviewer from Tuscon, I'd also have to assert that a great deal of the negative reports on the Samsung's quality are products of poor use or sheer dissemblance to the iPod. Make no mistake: the Samsung could still use a bit of improvement in the ease-of-use (mostly with the device itself rather than its music transfer capabilities) and compatablity departments, but it blows iPod out of the water so far as versatility, display quality, and overall attractiveness are concerned.   In terms of display, the Samsung offers a sizeable display along with brilliant color to more-than-accomodate it. However, whether one would find the color display of the Samsung or the color display of the new fourth-generation iPods is - I'd have to say - largely a matter of personal taste (as I own both devices): on the one hand, while the Samsung indeed offers a colorful and playful display, the iPod's new display - while less flashy - is...well, less flashy. In other words, if attractive simplicity is what you'd prefer, then perhaps the iPod is your ticket, but the Samsung still offers more than simply its impressive artwork, or even the per se attractiveness of the actual device.  The photo album/slideshow feature is also innovative and equally attractive, and uploading them in a cinch. In fact, uploading in general - contrary to some reports - is a cinch, though the same can't really be said for managing the device in other respects. The playlists can be somewhat intransigent at times in terms of their organisation.   Of course, one of the greatest stigma for those who find themselves considering whether it is safe to jump off the iPod bandwagon to switch to a PC-grounded or alternative player is the issue of not being able to take advantage of the myriad of accesories that now exist in the market for the iPod and don't yet exist on such a scale for even the most popular of alternative devices. Now if you're looking for an mp3 player that will serve more as portable stereo of sorts or a room-studio hub, then, again, perhaps the iPod is indeed your ticket. But if you're looking for an mp3 player that serves its purpose best as...an mp3 player, than you've found a superior one in the Samsung YH-925.  	1
So, I got my archos last week and i've been doodling with it - but get this: Playlists and videos don't work nearly as well as they should. Let's examine this:  1) Playlists. Do you want to be able to auto sync your WMP or media monkey playlists quickly to the archos? Sorry, won't happen, not even with the script someone came up with on archosforums. Even if you have your playlist in m3u, it gets converted to a non-playable wla file that crashes the archos. Fun right?  2) Videos. I use Clone DVD mobile to rip 720x404, 1900 bitrate. The videos work fine on my computer, but cut off 4/5 of the way through on the archos?  Are there ways around this? Well let's see. Like I said, someone created a script on mediamonkey to add playlists. I can't get it to work, but even so, why should you need a consumer-made script to get playlists to work? For videos, it's just finnicky with the encoding you use. Any hope for a firmware update to fix all this? Probably not if archos customer service is as bad as people say.  All in all, this was a waste of 380 as it has been more of a headache than a useful tool. Back to the store it goes. Of course, my alternative is an ipod. I might as well eat my own head.  	0
I bought my Zen V Plus about six months ago and have enjoyed it very much until it quit.  It went from working fine to not working without any dropping or other abuse.  The display froze up and multiple resettings would not help.  I could be just picky, but my prior mp3 player lasted two years and probably still works except I bought this better(?) one.  I now have a Toshiba Gigabeat.  If it turns to trash, I will listen to the radio.  	0
Did my research and read many good reviews. Had good experience with Samsung  products before and decided to buy this one. It is probably a good MP3 player in principle, but I never had a chance to enjoy it - its touchpad controls were so miscallibrated that I couldn't even play a song or enter any of the menus. Called up Samsung support and found out that there's no way to re-calibrate the controls, and the player had to be replaced. Decided to return it, as I no longer had any confidence in the product. But it looks cool. Will get a SANDISK Sansa now.   	0
I put it because one of the reviews here said the player came with a CD that had the Windows 98 driver. Well it didn't. And the driver at Coby's web site doesn't work. I installed it but Windows reports no driver. Fortunantly I bought it locally and can return it. But I'm agrreivated. Don't lie in reviews.  	0
I received this player and it seemed to be a great product for the 3 hours it worked.. I had charged the battery as indicated in the manual, loaded some music on it and listened for a while. Then after reconnecting it to my PC and removing it the device does nothing. A "hard reset" didn't help. Go over to the Sandisk site message board and read before buying this player. I did and ordered one anyway thinking it won't happen to mine... Now I'm going to try the Samsung U3.  	0
I got an ipod as a gift in July 2003, and had some problems with the software, and getting my computer to recognize the device, etc.  I had read a user review on Amazon stating that the software was &quot;flakey&quot;, and I didn't know what that meant until I got my ipod.  When it works, it really is great, I like the design and used it everyday, but it took a fair bit of tinkering around to get it to work.  The directions weren't helpful at all.<p>A previous reviewer wrote that he couldn't run with his ipod because it froze up constantly.  I run with mine everyday and have not had this problem.<p>I had some problems with the Music Match software.  Sometimes it would duplicate songs, and I could only delete one version.  I had to restore my ipod to factory settings a few times to remove duplicate versions of songs.  Apple came out with iTunes for Windows a few months after I got my ipod, and I've found it to be easier to use.<p>My ipod died completely, even though the battery was fully charged, in December 2003.  It didn't work for a few days, then I was able to revive it.  This happened 3 times before I sent it back.  Apple customer service kind of sucks, there is no 800 number to call for support, you have to register on their web site and email your problems in.  Within a few days of emailing Apple, I received a shipping box in the mail to return my ipod.  I sent it back and received a new ipod in less than a week. <p>I'm kind of skeptical that my new ipod will last any longer than the old one, but maybe I had a dud.  With the problems I've had, I can't really recommend the ipod, but it really is great when it works.  Definitely read the other user reviews before purchasing one though.  	0
Though this player's stats look good on paper, and the concept is a great one, do not buy it. I recieved one for Christmas last year, and the headphone jack fell INTO the player after a few months. Lexar sent me a replacement, which did not even work to begin with. They sent me another one, the headphone jack broke on that one too. After this they refused to give me a refund, but replaced it with their newest model mp3 player, the LDP-600. I am waiting to see if their are any defects, but this is a much nicer player. In closing, stay away from the Jumpgear, I loved it while it worked, but it is far to poorly manufactured to warrant any price.  	0
I use Ubuntu Linux, and had I known that Samsung's media player used Microsoft's MTP format, I would never have bought this device. Locked DRM ghettos destroy the value a customer seeks in a product. The proprietary player which ships with the device requires Windows to run, and is vastly inferior to my existing media solution (Amarok).  I can access the device with Ubuntu (the latest version, Gutsy Gibbon), but Samsung worked hard to spoil my experience. They feel they are 'protecting their rights,' but really, they're just shilling for Microsoft and spoiling my experience.  	0
This product was an insurance replacement for my previous Flashtrax.  I very much regret this purchase.  My photography store only carried these at the time, so I really had no choice since the Insurance Company put them in charge of replacing my goods.  Here are some of my reasons:  1) 8bit file system. Not only do I use this product for my photography, but I use it as an MP3 player and to transport files.  Unless you plan on time warping your computer back about 10 years, to an archaic 8bit file system, the truncation if files is an extreme annoyance. ie: "myfilename001.jpg" becomes "myfile~1.jpg" and Elvis Presley-Rubberneckin.mp3 becomes "elvi~1.mp3"  Finding the MP3 you want; forget about it.  2) File Sorting Lord have mercy on your soul if you listen to Audio Books.  I do.  Let's assume that I have time to rename 150 mp3 chapters of my audio book if 8 letters or less filenames.  Then I HOPE that each file was created/modified in order - You see, the P-2000 sorts files and folders according to DATE and TIME.  It's incapable of sorting files by filename!! You can't create any play lists OR listen to mp3s in order alphabetically or numerically!  3) Slow Copying files from my Sandisk Extreme III 82x 1gig CF card is slow and painful.  Hope you have a back up battery.  4) Highly Proprietary OS. Ok, so using the P-2000 for MP3's is useless, but at least I still have my photography, yeah?  So I've copied a fresh batch of Canon files to the P-2000 and wish to put them in a folder for viewing (they call them albums).  What the?!  Why are all of my files being copied, then renamed to some Epson proprietary naming system!?  My immaculate Canon file naming system is apparently not good enough this lil baby.  Instead of simply renaming the, the unit COPIES the files into the new files with new names taking up a lot of time, and wear and tear on the hard drive.  Also, can you say "bye bye battery?"  In general, using the file system with Windows file explorer is difficult.  Folders (or albums) that you see while using the unit are not the same that you see in Windows explorer  Example, Lets say you want to create a new folder to throw other photos in from you HDD.  Sorry, no.  You have to use Epson's proprietary "album creating" steps to do this.  Apparently Epson is still learning how to use a standard file system.  So now you're created a folder called "Photos from September 04th 2005; logically, you should be able to plug in your USB in and just copy your files over, yeah?  Sorry, no.  Now you have to find the CODE name Epson gave this album in you folder list.  Just finding the folder with the name you gave it would be too easy.  Epson called mine "ALBM0254." This meant that I had to search about 250 folders to find the one I just created.  I hoped "ALBM0254"  was the right one to copy my files into.  The best way to know for sure, is to put one file into the folder, unplug the device from the UBS, turn it on, browse to folder 254, see if the file is in there, if it is then plug it back in and copy the rest of the files over.  If not, well, try again.  5) Bad Battery?  Too bad. According to Epsons documentation, , using the P-2000 without a battery (AC Only) will damage the unit.  So, if my battery fails me at some point, and I have the day's worth of pictures on this unit, I am unable to recover them until I call Epson and order another proprietary battery. $80.  Until then my clients will just have to wait till a new battery shipped out to me.   6) Media Support Not all it's hyped up to be.  I haven't yet found a proper AVI/Mpeg that it can play.  It claims to be able to play QuickTime .MOV files, but the only one that I've gotten to play (aside from the sample it came with) was some weird and obscure music video I found on the net.  As the only playable MOV file that I've found, I keep it on my P-2000, so I can watch it every now and then feel like I haven't been raped by Epson.  If Cavemen had Portable Photo-Storage units, they'd have P-2000s;  Old technology based software and OS  7) Extra Stuff: I was spoiled by the accessories that came with my Flashtrax.  I got a remote control (which I honestly did use) and external Video / Audio cables to connect to my TV/Stereo.  The Epson does not come with those.  8) Technical Support. I have tried to contact Epson (Canada) in regards to the file sorting issues (twice) over the last week, however I have not heard back from them yet.    To be fair, this unit is much sturdier than my previous Flashtrax (after all, cavemen use it), and the battery life is excellent.  The screen and picture are excellent.   	0
I love this player!  I have had no issues with it whatsoever.  It is very easy to use and to program.  I will be buying more items from Creative Zen in the very near future!  	1
I love to know about new technologies and keep up with them...but it takes me awhile to purchase them...When I decided I needed an MP3 player, I just really didn't need a video or enough space for every piece of music that I ever owned....and I didn't want to spend a fortune. I LOVE MY NANO PLUS!  The software is so easy that my kids use it.  I have plenty of room for my favorite music, theirs and even some of dads! I have no idea how or why the ipods are so great, maybe it's hype....who knows...i do not feel like I am missing out on anything.  	1
Weve seen it so many times. Companies make a product that lookspretty cool, give it a name that most people will remember, andadvertise a lot.  Then it WILL sell, dosent matter how good the product actually is. RIO is a good example of that. And it was easy to do such a thing becourse the other portable mp3-players on the market are pretty anonymous. They dont advertise that much. Probably cuz they want to focus on doing a great player. Like the first portable mp3-player, MPMan. Its out in a new version that is far better than the RIO-player. It has flash memorycards, is easy to deal with and does even support other fileformats for storing. The main problem with mp3-players is the amount of space for storing music. To get near cd-quality you got to have 128kbps or more(156 recommended). The best solution to this right now i think is a player with a harddisk or cd-rom built in. Then you can store many hours and hours of music. But it makes a little bigger and more expensive player. So i think the next step from that is flash memory cards. They are small and can store pretty much and best of all they are replaceble. So, summary: Dont buy the RIO-player if not your only demand is to get a small player. Check out the other cool players instead.  	0
This wonderful tiny unit has it all!  I myself am not an ipod fan.  Yes, they do contain more memory but lack in other areas.  I needed a high quality voice recorder with decent sized memory capacity and this baby fits the bill with extras to boot.  A screen to view text or pictures, FM radio with great reception, time,voice recording and a host of other features which you may need in the future, if not right away. Rechargeable inbuilt battery that can run for 9 hours.  Sure beats having to constantly replace those draining AAA batteries. Its size is fantastic?  Discreet - unlike the somewhat larger ipods, which the same cannot be said about. You can clip this on your trouser loop and no one will be the wiser, and no chance of losing the unit either. I love it and cannot find a fault at this stage.  This lovely audio player is all I will need for some time. I don't know why some US sellers are unhappy about the US price tag.  In Australia the item costs twice as much and I still wouldn't trade it for anything else.  	1
The new iPod is, without a doubt, a perfect Mp3 Player; especially the feature of scrolling the lists up and down with simply moving the tip of your finger around the wheel. But there is one thing, not about this actual iPod, but about the reviews that Amazon and other sources give to such things. It's when they say, like, "Memory holds UP TO (example) 240 SONGS". IS "SONG" A NEW UNIT OF MEASURING THE SPACE? I'm used to using bytes, kilobytes, etc. It is not only technically incorrect to estimate the number of songs that the memory can hold (a single song can be 2, 4, 7, 10, (...) megabytes big, depending on its length and format), but it also pisses me off whenever I hear or read something like that.    	1
Now i didn't buy my nano from amazon but i did get the replasment scren off amazon... but anyway the ipod nano black 1st gen is really cool if you dont care about scraches and such. it looks cool becues of its shape and the point that it dosent look like a ipod mini. it also fits in your poket smother than a 2nd gen ipod nano... it also is easyer to fix on yor own. and hase cooler addons than the 2nd gen nano. so ya make shure you think about what you want to do befor buying this.  	1
I must preface this review with a confession.  I am *NOT* an Apple fan, but I'm slowing beginning to see the merit in many of the Apple products today.  My first computer was an Apple //e, and then I just moved on...  ...Twenty years later, I found myself looking for a birthday gift for The Wife.  I decided to get her something she could use to store the hundreds of pictures we have taken of our son.  I'm a believer of convergence, so I wanted to also put her music collection in the same device.  I immediately looked at Archos, iRiver, and Creative for their solutions.  Each one in turn was compared to the Apple iPod Photo.  Each one fell short.  Some had more storage but less battery life.  Some had difficult UI issues, others had navigation that was less than intuitive.  If the thing was for me, I'd have gone with the Archos for the storage size.  But The Wife doesn't need to be confused or annoyed with UI choices and over-capability.  Simple, direct, useful.  It doesn't hurt that the iPod is stylish, either.  I ordered one, and the optional dock, and the Griffin iTrip.  Took delivery quickly, opened up the well-designed packing, and was suprised at how small the iPod was.  Also, Apple will engrave a few sentences for free if you order directly.  Since this was a gift, that was the route I took.  Some things I didn't like?  Price.  The dock being made optional in this iteration of the iPod.  The lack of a Firewire cable, or AV cables.  Apple should be bundling these items with the iPod; breaking them out to soak customers will likely hurt them later.  If you accept the pricing and grab the optional items, you're in for a treat.  It worked perfectly out of the box.  Install the software, install the dock, dock the iPod.  I had her songs transferred over in less than an hour, her photos of our boy in less than ten minutes.  All 30 gigabytes were filled, too.  Now she has Axe from Brazil, Depeche Mode, and Metallica to get her to work and back; and now she can show off all 600 pictures of The Boy wherever she goes.    And she can finally stop asking me where all the pictures of The Boy are, because they will always be synchronized to the iPod.  And when she wants to hear her music, the iTrip will transmit on any free FM frequency to her car radio, or the kitchen radio, or wherever... and hopefully, she likes her birthday present.  Fred  	1
The H340 is the newest 40 gigabyte digital music player from iRiver, long a leader in MP3 type players. The unit is well built and does what it's supposed to do. It has very high sound quality and is fairly easy to use once you get over the initial short learning curve. Besides playing music files the system also allows you to store digital pictures and ebooks. The color display seems to be of good quality. File management is easy as the H340 hooks into your computer with a standard USB cable and allows you to create, move, and rename folders just like you would do on your internal hard drive. Moving music files is just a matter of dragging them into the folders. Setting up a play list is a snap using www.winamp.com which iRiver recommends.       The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is that there are a few areas for improvement. The first is that the supplied ear buds are just average. I replaced them with Sennheiser PX100 headphones (approx $40) which I have found to be some of the best sounding headphones on the market for portable music players. Another issue is the supplied case. Although it is of good quality you have to unsnap and remove the H340 from the case every time you want to access the controls. Hopefully iRiver or someone will come up with a case with a front access flap that fastens with velcro or something. Also the manual really isn't very good but it isn't too hard to figure the player out. Another issue I have is that it takes about 2 minutes for the H340 to load the 12 gigabytes of music that I have on it but once I got used to that it's not really a bother.      As far as a few other things, right now you can't look at pictures and listen to music at the same time although the unit's firmware is upgradeable so hopefully iRiver will add that in the future. Another issue is that the version of the H340 that has been on sale in Europe for several months allows you to download pictures directly from a digital camera into the H340 but the newer USA version requires that you download your pictures to a computer and then to the H340. I'm not sure why this is unless iRiver had some problems with the direct connect.      Overall this is a good unit somewhat ahead of the Apple IPod (At least as of today, things change quickly). If you are looking for a good portable digital player I would recommend the iRiver H340 or the H320 which is the same unit in a 20GB version for about $100 less.         	1
I have had this MP3 player for about 4 months and couldn't be happier.It came with an AAA battery which lasts from 15 to 20 hours.The sound during my exercise periods is excellent.It is easy to download music using a USB mini cable which attaches to the MP3 and will even let you know if you made duplicate selections. The small size in no way compromises the fidelity of the music.  I would strongly recommend this MP3 player for its value, acoustics and size.  	1
I like this MP3 player very much.  It has a lot of feature and it's easy to figure out all of the functions without even looking at the manual.  Everything is self explanatory. It sounds good enough with the headphones you get with it, but it will sound even better if you use your own set of headphones. The unit is nice and small in size, it holds a lot of songs and the one AAA battery lasts a long time. The only 2 minor negative thing about it are, #1 the FM tuner does not lock in every station on the dial.  #2 the display section (on the front of the unit) is made out of thin glass, which can easily crack.  It would be nice if the Company that builds them, would also supply a protective carrying pouch for it.  I rate it a 4.5 out of 5 stars (very good item).  Thanks MP      	1
Wow. What a difference a generation of MP3 players can make. Absolutely impressed with this model.  This thing has everything you could possibly think of, and more.  Especially like the progressive scanning. Very helpful when listening to long audio tracks.  	1
The player is cheap and easy to use, but comes bundled with a softwre music sales package that *you don't have to install to use the system* but which the documentation makes it sound like you must have to use it.  The Rhapsody system of BestBuy is the software it installs. This wouldn't be a problem, except the software requires you to pay a monthly service charge to use any of the music, and when you download (BUY) something, you will likely not get a set of files you can actually burn to a cd.  Oh, yes, it also overlays DRM on any media you have on your computer unless you say "no" during the long and onerous install process.  In general, cheap, but you are conned into paying lots and lots after you have it. In general, I say avoid. We got to sit through a lot of frustration trying to get the tech support to help. This is not a quality device. I would only recommend as a gift for someone you really don't like.  	0
Awesome little MP3/WMA player with FM Radio and Voice/Radio recorder as well. The screen is hard to read when not lit, but in the options I easily set it to display longer (0-45 seconds). I agree with the other reviewers in that you do have to skip songs to get to the one you want, and this unit does eat batteries for breakfast. I went thru one the first 24 hours I had it. Great sounding ear buds, and great sounding unit. Unit has an equilizer with presets for various types of music and srs. I love the look of it and how the aliens eyes light up when the backlight is on, not too happy their yellow and not green lol.. Buy it, you'll love it!  	1
I have actually had my Creative Zen Touch for going on five years now, and it still works as flawlessly as the day I bought it. It's a real pity Creative doesn't make them anymore.  I am not gentle with my electronics. I have dropped, washed, left it out in the car, and who knows what else. The (somewhat) cruddy carrying case has long since fallen apart, I've had to purchase new earbuds over and over again as the old ones fall apart, but my Zen is still miraculously going strong.  Although bulky, I find that that larger size is a benefit more than a hindrance. If you drop it, you don't have to freak and wonder if you'll have to shell out another $250+ for a replacement.  Mind you, there are some negative factors as well, most of them applying to the software. I prefer ripping my cds with Windows Media Player, and occasionally I'll rip songs and the software simply won't recognize that there's an mp3 on my computer. I'll open the folder and the software just shows it as empty space. The only way to avoid that problem is by ripping the cd with the software's ripping program, and it's frustrating that you can't change the song quality. Also, I enjoy listening to music from many different countries, and, although when you first set up the software it supports all languages, if you should need to switch computers or download the software to a new computer, there's no longer any language support. You can fiddle with that program as much as you want and download as many patches as you can, it doesn't matter. You'll just have to find the romanized titles for those songs, or the song'll just appear on your mp3 player as gibberish.  Despite these setbacks, the fact remains that the mp3 player itself is sturdy, dependable, and, most imoprtantly, still working. It breaks my heart, but I've been having to look for a new one for no other reason than that I no longer have any room on my old one. And it breaks my heart even more that I can't just get an upgraded version of this one.  	1
I purchased this item for myself with my Christmas bonus.  My brother turned me on to Archos a while ago.  He bought his wife a unit that just displays pics and plays music.  While exploring their site I came across the AV700 and realized that this was the one for me!!  Since it's more costly, I've waited til now to purchase - it was soooo worth the wait!!  I love this thing!!  I've downloaded movies, music, pics and also DVR'd TV shows & movies.  I use mine mostly to watch stuff and you can easily view your downloads or DVR's on the screen.  The initial set-up of the different downloads (music, pics, movies, dvr) is not the best, takes a few times of going over the directions (which are minimal at best) to get the hang of it.  But once you've mastered them, it's very simple.  Also, it was great that it came with all the accessories needed.  My husband was so impressed with mine, that he had me go back online and order up one for him!!    	1
The only thing this remote does reliably is either claim to be out of range (5 feet from Ipod) despite multiple resets and resyncs of both the remote and the ipod, and freeze the ipod. Pity because it is a great idea for folks who hook their ipods up to their stereos and want to be able to control them.  	0
Short life span and very sensible controls than can be fixed easily reflashing the unit. No mayor complains.  	1
Very happy for the 1st 3 weeks and then problems started to occur.  I put it in my back pocket of my pants and I guess my walking around while listening to it caused some kinda of warping (but MP3 players are built to stand some warping, right?).  First the screen died so I can only use the buttons to navigate to play the music.  Then the battery would suddenly discharge for no obvious reasons.  Now (3 months from the date I made the purchase) the whole player doesn't even work any more.    I am frusrated but I can't return it since I bought it in the US and relocated to Asia.  Don't buy it!  	0
Great for a few months then died - do not buy.  	0
My girlfriend purchased the Sandisk this for me for Christmas. I was excited and loaded the entire space used for about a month then couldn't get it to charge on anyone's computer try mine hers and others no go.  I will spend a little more money and get something that won't break in a month. I had one that worked with Triple A batteries but only 128 MB buts its still ticking.   Not a very good product very disappointed. Not sure I will purchase another of this brand.  	0
Just got my mine in the mail from Amazon.com, plugged it in for a battery charge, loaded all of my favorite songs at the same time. And now, I am listening to each one of them. The quality of the sound is very clear and loud if you wish it that way. It's got a shuffle functionality which works perfectly if you go to the gym and don't want to listen to only one album. The little device is so light too. I mean. 5 stars is well deserved for it. Lastly, the 14 hours of battery is true. :) Enjoy!  	1
Throughout all of my experiences of shopping for a perfect portable   media player I have decided that no such device exists. The Archos Av 500 is one of the closest to that high standard.      The AV500 has all of the requirements for a great pmp and then some. However, it also has it's flaws. It boosts a monsterous 4 inch LCD which is one of the biggest save for the Archos AV700 (that supports a lousy resolution).     I purchased the 30GB model and I was impressed right off the bat with the power of the videocorder function but was unimpressed with the fact that there is no middle ground between the 30GB model and the 100GB model memory wise. I really wanted a 60GB version that cost somewhere in between the two.      The movies look spectacular when you connect a dvd/vhs/tv input and record at the right settings, I didn't even try to go the computer route because the AV500 has such a simple recording interface that there is no desire to use the computer as a middle man between the dvd and the Archos. Several dozen recordings later, I thought about attempting to go the computer way and I found a very interesting peice of info that I would like to pass on to you. The resolution recording settings on the archos are VGA (640x480) and a lower version of 512x(something I forgot). However, the screen resolution is 480X272. When the archos has to shrink the picture, it causes some distortion in the picture quality. This happens because there aren't enough pixels for the video resolution. The archos then decides whether or not to show some of the pixels and when the camera is moving or there is a particuarly large amout of detail on the screen then the garbage quality is shown on the screen. If you can find a good dvd to avi converter program (I used the "dvd to pocket pc" program from www.pqdvd.com) then I recomend that you set the settings to have the output resolution to be exactally 480x272. I did this and I recieved a picture resolution that I thought was literally DVD quality. It blew me away! Note: If you go this route then you cannot use the cropping feature.   If you dont want to go that way, then use the onboard recording feature. Be warned that it is very possible to make the recording look like crap so pay close attention.  The way to avoid this is to set the resolution at VGA and keep the KBS at 1500 (the files become a size that about 16-18 movies can be stored on the AV500). This sweet spot is my key to making the movies that I record look on par with DVDs on my AV500's screen (not a tv output). I encountered some glitches (the AV500 randomly froze during a recording process)that caused me to worry at first but several recordings later and I forgot all about them.      One secret hidden feature that I had no idea about was the editing feature of video files. Due to the fact that I wanted as many movies on my Archos as possible and that I typically only watch the action sequences, I was able to cut out all of the scenes of Anakin Skywalker and Padme in Star Wars Episode III to make a 45 minute movie that jumped from one action sequence to another. I am now able to get all of the aciton from any movie into one file roughly 300-700MBs which allows me to fit 50-60 movies on my Archos.     The photo feature is OK. I say "ok" as a way of being nice. The photo feature is there so i can't really complain. However, it sucks. The photo feature has very limited zoom function that becomes quite annoying. The load times are delayed just slightly which made the device seem a bit slow compared to the fact that it can record a tv signal at VGA resolution with 2500 kbs and sound at 48khz.     The device went above and beyond on the music standards. The AV500 automatically sorted all of my music files into categories such as Artist, Genre, Album, ect. The music from the headphones sounds nice but the built in speaker comes up just a little bit short, a very little bit. The control of a built in equalizer was also a very nice touch.     One of the flaws that I came across was the USB host and what it could connect to. My deepest desire was to connect the AV500 to a portable USB hard drive and cut a corner to save me money from spending 700 dollars on the 100GB version but that plan failed. The AV500 flat out didn't recognize the hard drive. The Archos will however connect to a digital camera and a desktop hardrive but no portable ones.     The feel of the Archos (which I should have probably talked about at the beginning of this review) is that of a peice of solid metal except for those lousy buttons! The face buttons of the AV500 are the worst part of the whole device. I can't stop giggling them while I am watching my non-stop action movies.     All in all, the AV500 is the best gadget for your buck. It has it's minor flaws but the tought of overlooking them isn't really that bad. The AV500 out performed every single other pmp that I have tried and belive you me, my quest for the perfect pmp has driven me to nearly try every single one.  (...)  	1
I already had a Sony minidisk player.......but the zen is ligher and comes with the advantage of the box and armband......awesome sound quality and the FM tuner is sweet....whenever you get tired of the mp3s you can switch to a station and listen something unexpected!.....helps me keep my mp3 collection updated by introducing new songs!......also, you can use it as a portable harddisk....for those last minute files while you are leaving the office!.......for a small gadget, it packs quite a punch! My only criticism, the controls are packed with too much functions.....oh well, I can live with that....nice toy!   	1
This thing didn't last long at all.  First month worked fine.  Second month, the files started to randomly get shuffled into other files.  Third month, the folder files were unable to be deleted off the player, and the screen gave foreign jargon instead of english, so I had to remember how to get to menu items by counting 'clicks' and 'ups and downs'.  Fourth month, the screen went out.  Bottom line, stick with a proven technology leader like Sandisk, who have been making quality flashdrives for years.  I've got one of their players and have had not one problem for nearly a year.  	0
I've just received my AV 700 and had a chance to put it through its paces.  I prepared some of my videos, and downloaded them, with some music and photos.  Video playback is just beautiful.    I've read the other reviews, and I have had NONE of the problems described in any of them.  After changing the AV700 to a "hard disk" from its default ID, I was able to successfully connect it to my WinXP PC.  I had to try a couple of different USB ports, for some strange reason, but I don't consider that a problem  I get fine sound, excellent picture quality, good all around responsiveness, and am please with the unit.  It has excellent construction quality.    I've ordered a second battery, but I figure that's just common sense.    Archos has done their homework, and they have a first rate product.  UPDATE:  If anything, I feel even more upbeat about the AV 700 than I did when I first wrote the review.  For example, attention to detail: The relevant buttons on the remote are identical to those on the unit (plus of course the buttons to control other devices, TV, etc.).    I'm 65, and intuitive familiarity with all these new gadgets doesn't come easily, but it surely has for the AV 700.  Also, I note that "Gadget Guy," Matthew Wy, who wrote a very downbeat review, has written 4 reviews, all of them on Archos products, and strangely enough, all 4 identical.  I mean verbatim!  Except for one missing sentence in one of the reviews.  Food for thought!    	1
I got this two days ago and have tried it.My experience is that1-It is large compared to Archos av400 and 500,although specs on paper do not indicate that it is too large.2-The screen resolution is very poor even when watching tv the contrast and brightness are low ,picture is like you see on 30 years old TV set.Also there is no setting available for contrast and brightness 3-It is very slow to start.4-There is no true FF and rewind only 2x,4x &8x frame advance &rewind is available.A 2 hour movie takes you at least 15 minutes to go from begining to end or end to begining.There is no bookmark function.5-A firmwareupdate at their Japanese site is not compatible with Units sold in US I e mailed them & did not get any answer.So forget about any support or warranty coverage.The videos I have encoded for Archos JBM20 & av700 play only on a smaall area of middle of screen although they play on whole screen on 1.6" & 7" archos units.I canot find any positive in this unit and wasted $228.I will not advise anybody to buy it.No wonder they are closing it out on Computer Geeks.  	0
Love it.  It's great.  Easy to use.  Small.  Excellent. No complaints.  	1
Do not buy this. The 40gb hard drive and the "features" mask the true quality of this product. The firmware is terrible. Folder and filenames only show the first 5 characters, making it hard to find anything. The pause/play button does not always work when listening to music. Folder and file navigation is way too slow. The volume on this thing is extremely weak. Video conversion software that is included does not work (winXP & WME9). Seems to me that the manufacturer tried to make it as cheap and as quickly as possible. It's a good idea, it's just that they should have spent more time tweaking it. If you have the money for one of these things, save another $100 and buy a video iPOD.  P.S. - Anyone know if the PVR firmware is linux based?  	0
Don't believe the negative reviews. I've had two of them in the house for almost 6 months. No problems. They are great for downloading books on tape and music. Some libraries offer free downloads that will work on this Creative Zen Nano. They are small and easy to carry around---weigh almost nothing! Email:boland7214@aol.     	1
I bought my player from Costco a few months ago. I love the thing to death. Couple things to improve on... a protective skin would be a nice option, and an expandable memory. I love this player for it's compactness, however the memory is just okay. When I bought this product I thought it would be perfect for me, small and lightweight, but only room for approx. 120 songs. It fit a reasonable amount of songs on there, but not all of my collection. One of my only complaints is that mine wouldn't do a playlist, which is fine for me, it would have been a nice feature. I love the "on the fly" radio recording and the voice recording, for notes, ideas and thoughts. All in all, this is a great beginning product.  	1
This product is simply not ready for prime time.  It's an expensive piece hardware that delivers little for the money other than sheer frustration!  The reasons are as follows:  -  In order to transfer music to it you have to sign up with Napster.  What a complete MESS!  Samsung has every right to use proprietary software, but they have a duty to make it workable without requiring a sign up over the Internet with a propritary  seller of songs.  I would NEVER have bought this had I known the extent of the interconnection required to operate basic player features.    -  There are far better players, at far less cost, that simply let you drag and drop your music from the hard drive of your computer to the player without all the excessive work of this Samsung model.  Napster software constantly reported that it needed to stop Windows Media Player when WMP was not running!  I even downloaded the latest version of Napster software - that only made it worse!  When I finally gave up, I did a registry clean-up and there where over 100 corrupt registry entries from Napster and Samsung software.  -  The mass storage device software is very poor.  I have other removeable mass storage devices, from various makers, and they work just fine right out of the box!  This one is more than useless.  It's also slow, slow, slow, slow.  It often takes up to a minute for the system to recognize it, if at all (that happened several times); a system with plenty of memory to spare (over 512 meg of memory), and in excess of 2g speed.  -  The device is so "touchy" that it lost it's file system at least four times and I had to use the provided repair utility to get it to work again.  It took me several times to get the repair utility to work.  -  I have over 2 decades experience with computer hardware and software.  I spent well over 15 hours trying to get this to work properly.  It is not plug-and-play by ANY means.   This device suffers badly from very poor proprietary software that simply fights with the Windows operating system at every step.  Samsung puts out some good products, but this one goes to the very bottom of the pile.  	0
Only someone who is from another planet would buy this player. It has problems playing MP3 and WMA files. It forces you to use the dumb Sony software. It costs more than an IPOD.. In short.. buy something else. Sony get your act together.. You invented this category and now you have lost it  	0
For its price, it would be hard to pass up on an MP3 player with 5 GB of memory with the style, size, and ease of use.  Controls on the player are intuitive and easy to use.  This is a plug and play device that doesn't require much to operate.  The touch pad lights up when it is touched and is responsive.  The headphones leave a lot to be desired and should be upgraded with a 3rd party set.  Conversion of music is relatively easy.  Drag and drop is a limitation since this software does not allow it.  Songs must be checked to be synced.  However, with the nearest competitor priced at $159 with rebates, it is a small price to pay for the inconvenience.    For someone on a budget, I highly recommend this model.  For an audiophile or IPOD afficianado, there are better alternatives.  	1
I baught it and feel like throwing it from the highest floor for the following reasons;  1... Like most MP3 players I have used you cannot drag and drop music files directly to the player.  2... SonicStage Software used to "manage" the file transfers SUCKS. Sony should consider firing its software writing staff, or outsource its software from good people.  3... No songs list. Can only list by Artist /Album/Genre/Group/Others. Dude where my file list?  4... Why on earth do we need another audio format (OMG) ?  5... Did I mention that the software sucks?  Avoid till sony releases a better audio manager.  	0
The headphone jack started cutting out after a few months. One channel is now completely dead.  The screen is easily cracked (my fault, but nevertheless....) and the battery cover is loose and feels like it will fall off.  I would not purchase this or the larger capacity (2GB I think) built with the same design.  Junk - worthless now.  	0
I had high expectations for this product, having bought some of Sandisk's other products. The problem with the e280 is that Sandisk doesn't give users the control or the versatility over file management. For example, using it in the (mass storage) MSC USB mode, one is forced to create playlists in Windows Media Player. This works, but one of the drawbacks is that playlist creations can be plagued with files that have errors or are skipped.   It would be far better if one could just drag folders and music mp3 files to the right folder and play them, with multiple folder levels. This would allow catogorizing music the way the user wishes; instead, Sandisk adopts an almost Microsoft mentality in its approach. "It's our way or the highway." Once one masters creating playlists, they have to settle for dumping them all into one directory.  It's too bad because reading the manual and reading the reviews, one can easily get the idea that the e200 series can be set up like just another USB storage device (including other, previous Sandisk products). Well, you can, but it won't make much difference if the device won't play.     	0
I stopped using this product after a few weeks because of its limitations, which when added up make it a poor entertainment buy in my opinion.  No secret is made of the fact that this device only picks up the XM signal when it is tethered to its antenna and cradle... you can't get the signal on the go.  This actually isn't as bad as it might seem.  You can easily set up the device to record many hours of your favorite XM channel overnight for example and listen to it on the go later.  You can delete songs you don't like and you will eventually end up with quite a bit of music you do like.  It records XM music at a fairly low bitrate (128 kbps), which does not give you a high quality recording.  It could be that XM's signal doesn't broadcast at a higher bitrate, which would mean this limitation isn't the product's shortcoming, but rather XM's.  The user interface (a 'special' version of Napster) can be extremely frustrating in terms of getting it to recognize the Nexus device until you realize you have to start the software and plug in the device in a particular order, which the user manual doesn't tell you - neither did customer support at either Samsung or Napster.  In fact, I was told things about the device and the software that were so clearly wrong as to be sadly comical.  For instance:  Napster told me the software can only manage music purchased from Napster, which is clearly wrong.  The Nexus manual tells you in writing that "you can only transfer songs [between the Nexus and your PC] that you have purchased from XM+Napster or songs that you have ripped from your audio CDs."  This too is clearly wrong.    All the above in my opinion isn't even the worst of it.  This product, tied to XM Radio service, can obviously be no better than XM Radio itself.  I wanted very much to like XM but could not get over the fact that even though you are paying $12.95 a month, they still talk over the music, and they play plenty of ads and irritating XM 'jingles'.  I have cancelled service due to these issues.  I don't see the point for all the XM-originated chatter and channel ID jingles when you can simply look at your device to see what channel you're listening to (and paying for) if you can't tell from the music selections.  I tried out XM a few years back for a few months (cancelled for other reasons) and the talk-over and extraneous jingle issues seem much worse now than they once were.  I have found internet-based sources of free music that is free of ads and chatter, and which can be recorded on your hard drive with various available software... and at higher bitrates that are of noticeably higher quality.    	0
I bought this a year ago thinking it was a step above the iPod because it played video and pictures.  Besides the fact that the new iPod can now do both, I was still wrong.  For one thing, this Lyra is quite bulky, making it very inconvient to bring around wherever you go, which is what I like to do.  Another thing is its much more difficult to sync to your computer.  You can use it with Windows Media Player, but whenever I tried to add even a few cds worth of music it seemed to take forever because it had to convert all of the files (even though they were alread mp3's)  Navigation is another feature that the Lyra is bested by the iPod in.  It takes so long to scroll through all the artists on the Lyra.  You just have to old the down button for what seems like hours to get to the artists in the middle of the alphabet.  Playlists are another things that the Lyra just does not do well in.  The only way I ever figured out how to make playlists was on the Lyra itself, and this took forever. Youd have to go through and select the songs you want (which as I said earlier, takes forever scrolling through the songs) and then add them to the playlist. But you can only have so many selected at a time, so it enlongated the process further.  Battery life is just not acceptable.  It seemed to last a good amount when listening to just music, but viewing pictures or videos drained it much quicker.  I'm not sure you could get through a whole movie on one charge.  The final thing was after just a year of very light use (it was too heavy to bring with me too often), it just died.  Wouldnt turn on or anything. Now lucky for me, I had bought the extended warrenty at Best Buy, and when I took it back, they gave me the new 30 GB iPod video, which as I have mentioned, enjoy and use much more often then the Lyra.  So save your money and buy an iPod instead.  	0
I must preface my comments by saying that I am a professional videographer and producer for 15 years.  I had no problems with calculus at 15 years old. For the most part I am fairly adept at getting around what most would consider problems on the computer.   The good: The design itself is excellent and attractive.  The bad: Almost everything else  The software is by download only. Don't buy this as a present for a friend in a country where high speed internet is uncommon. I spent hours trying to upload my very rare collection of classical CD's that I spent thousands on.  I tried every trick I could think of to organize the files.  Originally I bought a Samsung K3 for a friend and had no problem upload the music. I believe the K3 can even operate without the Samsung software. I thought I could not go wrong with a Microsoft player that was second generation and offered 8 gigs of storage. I could not have been more wrong.  Unless you are satisfied with music downloads only you are wasting your money on this device.  If you are so lucky as to be able to get your files into this player you will then find out that both the software and the player have minds of their own.  No matter how painstaking you may label you files they software will rename the music. I may even revert some of the names to things on the web which are often incorrect.  I have no idea where it was getting the info from.  Originally I wanted to load some Pimsleur language CD's on it and the player failed miserably.  it refused to recognize my WMA files that were burned from my personal discs on windows media player.  After an extended effort I got "most" of them to be seen but they were placed in a very odd order. it is unacceptable to be forced to go through anything close to the procedures I went through.  It should not be a requirement to trick the player to get the music on.  It is obvious that Microsoft wants you to spend the extra money to buy their music.  It was only after the fact by going on line at the Zune site with a problem that they state how resistant the player is to any file that is not one of theirs. Check this out for yourself. Quote from Zune web page: If you buy protected songs from someplace other than Zune Marketplace, for example, they won't work with Zune. If your content is in a format that doesn't work with Zune and it's not protected, you might be able to convert it.    What is up with "might" be able to convert?  I cannot describe the frustration as a result of the hours I wasted trying to make this work.  I hate to be defeated but that is not even the point here.  The near complete lack of organizational ability in conjunction with the restrictiveness of this unit are nothing less than appalling.  this is in no way a "personal" player.  It is an unwitting investment in Microsoft.  ...and yes, I am a PC user exclusively.  A last note is that it is very susceptible to fingerprints and they are hard to remove from the screen.     	0
I have had the pleasure of owning a Zen Touch for the past three years now! The only problem I have had to date is that I lost the power adapter; seriously, that's it!  The Zen Touch has solid construction (I've dropped it several times), is easily navigable, has great sound and has an amazing file capacity. I tried to get into the I-pod hype, but saw so many other cost effective alternatives; I thought I would try to make Mac work harder for my affection (not even the i-phone has swayed me yet).  Although I am a subscriber to Sirius Satellite Radio and make huge use of the Stiletto that boasts a pretty sizable mp3 capacity itself (along with recorded radio files and internet radio capability), I still use my Zen Touch heavily for work at our after school programs.  I would go to bat for the Zen Touch any day (although I don't think Creative makes them any more). I will use my Zen until they start downloading music directly to my brain... we, even then the Zen would probably be way more reliable (I've had to reboot the old noggin quite a few times since I work with kids).   	1
I received this as a gift just yesterday and fell in love with it. I had been searching for the right Mp3 player for months when I happened upon a walkman bean ad in a fashion magazine I was reading. Its look was unique, it stood out from the others I had looked at. Although pink is not my favorite color, (I would have preferred blue had it come in the one-gigabyte format) this pink is irredescent and pleasently between shouting hot pink and icky baby pink, and I have to say, I don't mind carrying around (and flaunting) my pink bean. Anyhow, onto more important specs. I was a teeny bit worried when I read all those "reviews" about the bean having hissy audio, but, after using mine non-stop for the past day, I can say that is not an actual issue. The only time my music is hissy is when it's supposed to be (Shiina Ringo). Another rumor being that it is made unusable by a two-foot drop is also false. Accidentally, of course, my bean fell out of my pocket (a good three feet from the ground), made hard contact with the floor, yet, with my headphones still on my head and attached to the bean, I could hear there was no halt in the music, nor degradation of performance. All the buttons still functioned. And I let out a sigh of relief. The screen is high-contrast and easily read from two feet away. My bean also has two "screensavers", quite a surprise to me, as they were never mentioned in any reveiw or by sony themselves. Yet it is one of my favorite things about the bean. The first screen has strawberries, cherries, bananas, grapes, apples AND oranges skimming across the screen. That one always puts a smile on my face. The one that really made my day though, was the sky screen. When you set the time on your bean, as the day progresses, you get a different screen. In the morning, you get a little sunshine with fat little birds flying past. At midday, the sun is shining with clouds and jet planes flying past. During the evening, the sun sets, with thin, foggy clouds floating past and seagulls flapping into said sunset. Once it hits 7 p.m., or 19:00 (depending on you preference), The crescent moon comes out and stars sparkle behind it as little clouds whiz by. The last screen is the time-and-date display, which are shown inside bubbles. The bean can repeat and shuffle, which I have mine set on all the time. However, now for the sad points. It is   advertised as being able to hold 695 songs. Mine has 194 with enough room left over for four more songs, but that's on high-quality. I'm sure it can hold more if you're NOT an audiophile such as myself. Also, as I have read in other reveiws, the hold button is a pain. That's because it is not a button of its own, rather, it is the difference between closing the usb-port's cover most of the way and all the way. Not a major problem, but it can drive you buggy until you're used to it. Now, the only terrible problems I had in this experience were not about the bean itself, but what came with it (the earbuds included with my bean were lop-sided, the 5 free music downloads included had an illegible redemption code), and I have to say, I wouldn't trade it for anything! I love it more than the hi-fi cd player that it's replacing (believe it or not)! The SonicStage software needed to use the bean is an easy setup, not the best, but better than others I've sampled. Overall, I find this to be a great Mp3 player and reccommend it to anyone, who, like me, would rather not buy an iPod. This is the first, and probably the only Mp3 player that I will own or even want to own. I sleep with it under my pillow. If it wasn't so small, I'd give it a hug.  	1
I really like this MP3 player overall.  It doesn't hold a lot for those that want to puit multiple albums on their player but for me it was plenty.  It does seem a little confusing to operate but I am getting the hang of it.  	1
I ordered a refurbished mp3 player from dealcat.com with the assurance that I couold return it if it did not work.  However, I have found that dealcat.com will not answer their phones, call back, ir respond to e-mails.  I would strongly suggest avoiding this company for anything product one might be interested in.  	0
I purchased this Meizu Mp3 Player for my daughter for Christmas 2007. First, of all the controls are difficult to navigate, (a combination of buttons and touch controls) and the instructions were of no help.  Secondly, the unit worked for 3 hours and them the display went to French, scrambled then shut down after 2 1/2 hours.  We thought that the battery was just low so we charged it for 5 hours but the unit refused to turn back 'ON.'  We return it an bought another brand.  Please don't waste you money on this item when there are better quality units for a similar price.  	0
I purchased my Zen player with high hopes that were ultimately crushed by their technical support.  I am a pretty savvy, techno-geek but I met my match with the mp-3 player from Creative.  After experiencing set up problems, I contacted their tech. support.   I spoke to a friendly girl who seemed to be dazed by even the smallest technical problem which she was obviously enslaved to answer.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  When I was told I would be contacted in 24 hours by a supervisor to clear the problem, I returned the product.  I never heard back from the girl's supervisor, nor was the problem ever resolved.  	0
I own both the iPod (5.5) and the Zune - buy a Zune. Not only does it not scratch or get generally as dingy looking as an iPod - the screen is absurdly larger due to not having to put the brilliant "let's see how we can test our opposable thumbs wheel" navigation "aid" on the device. Not to mention, the interface itself is much more attractive and the device itself has more capabilites than the iJunk. But that's me...and not wanting to have to go through another 3 day - yes - days - synch between my WMA files and iTunes sad attempt at conversion.  	0
Trust me, I was the LAST person to buy an iPod. I was perfectly happy with my iRiver H140 (which I still love), and was sick to death of seeing those white headphones everywhere! But then I decided to get a tinier player for my walks to class and such. I tried out different smaller players and they all had some type of defect. An iPod Shuffle wasn't an option as the thing doesn't even have a screen. When these second-generation minis came out, I was blown away by the specs: supposedly 18 hours of battery life, price cut down fifty dollars, etc. So I went ahead and bought the blue version and yet to have any regrets. My review:  PROS:  // I did a battery test on this the afternoon I bought it. It wasn't even charged to full capacity, and on top of that, I played with it a lot, and it still ran continuously for about 23 hours. Amazing. One of the reasons I was hesitant about getting a first-generation mini was its battery life (about eight hours, I believe). Apple has definitely improved on this feature.  // iTunes, the software that you use to put music on your iPod, is great. You can make it automatically sync to your iPod or manually update. I choose the latter option as I have more music on my computer than will fit on a 4GB player. I thought having to use software would be annoying in comparison to hooking a player up like a regular hard drive and using the file tree method, but iTunes is simple and gets the job done. There are other programs you can use to manage your iPod, like MusicMatch, but iTunes seems to be the least clunky to me. Also, you DO NOT have to buy from the iTunes music store to work your iPod. You can even hide this option on the sidebar if you wish and make iTunes solely a music manager.  // So tiny! I have to admit that when I opened the box, I exclaimed, "It's SO cute!" It's basically the size of a credit card. A little slimmer, a little longer, but you get the idea. Even the package it comes in is very compact!  // Sound quality is absolutely superb. You'll listen to songs that you've heard on your computer or other MP3 player or whatever and hear nuances that you haven't heard before. Like I said, I have an iRiver, and while that has amazing quality too, you'll be surprised how crisp this little device sounds.  // Plenty of features. Notes, contacts, games (Music Quiz, Solitaire, Brick and Parachute), clock, alarm... I have yet to use any of these extras but I guess it's nice to know that they're there in case you do. I think more efficient features would be voice recording, FM tuner, etc.  // Scratch-resistant. All of my friends' iPods are scratched up like you wouldn't believe. The mini has a lot more resistance to scratches as it has an anodized aluminum case.  // Inuitive design. Everyone knows about the click wheel. I've handled lots of different players and Apple really wins in this area. The controls are underneath the wheel, so you don't have to worry about buttons bulging out on the exterior.  // Colors-- this is a pretty trivial point, but I was initially disappointed when these "new" colors came out. I thought the earlier model pastels were much prettier. However, now that I actually have one (photos don't do justice), I think my blue one has a gorgeous, rich hue, and I imagine this is the same for the green and pink. No complaints in the aesthetics department from my end.  CONS:  // No support for WMAs. iTunes will import these as their own format, which might result in a sound degradation. I had to rip a bunch of my CDs as MP3s just to retain original audio quality.  // Apple really skimped out on the accessories. I'm used to getting a bunch of add-ons with my player for free, like a case and adapter. The mini includes a clip-on holder, headphones, and your charging cord, but that's pretty much it. HOWEVER, to Apple's credit, you can charge your iPod without an adapter (right from USB, or Firewire). Plus, to get these 4GB models down cheaper than they were before, it makes sense that they cut out the superfluous items.  // This will be a minor issue for most people, but when you're in your menus (like listings under Songs or Albums or wherever), the titles don't scroll. So if you have a lot of songs that start with the same string of words, you're going to have try them all to see which one you're looking for. On the actual now-playing screen, they DO scroll, it's just that in the menus they don't. Like I said, this won't affect most people, but it did kind of annoy me when I first saw it as all other players I've worked with scroll titles in menus.  SOME THINGS TO KNOW:  // The iPod never actually shuts off. I know that when I first got this, I was like, "Where's the stop button?!" You can put it to sleep by holding the play/pause button down for a few seconds, but it will never actually be turned off. This is a smart move made by Apple because if you were to continually shut off and restart everytime you wanted to use it, not only would it take a long time to boot up, but it would wear down its interior.  // iPod doesn't give you a straightforward way to copy your music back onto your computer after putting it on, but there's a way to do so without using external programs if it's enabled to disk usage. 1) Click on the iPod icon in My Computer. 3) Click Tools > Folder Options > View > Show Hidden Files and Folders. 3) A folder called "iPod Control" should appear. Navigate into that folder and all your music should be in several different folders within. If you don't want to do it this way, there are also third-party programs like CopyPod.  // For iPod support, Google "iPodLounge." Their forums are really helpful, too.  // Ordering from Amazon is probably your best bet. I ordered this on March 17 and received it the very next day on March 18. That was with Super Saver Shipping deal where it's actually supposed to take up to two weeks to get to you! This could just be in my lucky case, but even so, you can also always return your iPod if something is wrong with it with zero hassle and for free. Like with those other players that gave me issues? Amazon sent a UPS guy to my house to pick it up, returned it, and I got ALL of my money back. Just my two cents on that.  ---  Overall, a great player. Besides a few flaws, Apple has found a new iPod-lover in me which I thought NEVER would happen! Sorry for the length of this review but I hope it helped potential buyers. Happy iPodding. :)  	1
This is the best mp3 player EVER!!  the screen is pretty big and holds ALOT of music and videos...has too many options to mention....but for the money, its a great buy!  	1
I found this product to be absolutely terrible.  Yes, it does eliminate buying a CD Writer in some respects, however, the lack of time available is unfortunate.  It's not worth the money.  MP3's are absolutely amazing,  although the technology is not refined enough to hit hand held,  take my  advice go with a CD Writer and you can copy much more than an audio median.  	0
The following review is only interesting for photographer:  The main reason for me to buy the product was to backup and store photos from my Canon to a harddisk and have a fast viewer for the photos. I shoot the photos in .jpg and .raw format.  I upgraded my Archos 504 from the former AV 420 which did support .jpg and .raw backup from my Canon, but the photo viewer was incredible slow.  You don't find any Information about storing the .raw format on your Archos... I bought the product in the believe that an upgrade can't mean a step back in the development... which was an error... it really DONT support .raw ... I asked the helpdesk if they plan to support the .raw file in future... their answer was NO, they decided against raw format.  Nevertheless the picture viewer and the video things work fine, just for those who want to store .raw files as in the past, forget it...  Thanks Archos, so you make it easy for photographer to change the backup system to other companies like Creative.   	0
The Sandisk Sansa e280 is straight up garbage.  I had to take it back on 4 seperate occasions because the the memory froze and could not be reset.  when you load all of your songs and movies, sometimes the songs don't appear on your Mp3 player.  you have to load it 3 or 4 different times to get in on your ipod. the buttons on the sansa are pretty damn small as far as the arrows. the volume button and volume button navigation is well thought out but as far as the unit as a whole, I would give a D-. Very sloppy craftsmanship and I think they need to recall this item and fix the errors or else they probable will soon loose repeat business.  	0
I bought an iriver H10 20GB in Nov 2005.  It froze up and required resetting within the first week.  I returned it only to receive another one just like it the next month.  Neither unit ever worked when I wanted it to.  It constantly froze up and/or turned itself on (even in lock mode) only to run down the battery.  Most upsetting is that I spent $270 on an MP3 player that NEVER worked and then had to spend another $250 on an iPod this February.  Good news- the iPod has never failed!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON iRIVER PRODUCTS.  	0
This is a fantastic product - if you can get it. I ordered a 256MB DMK, but it came with a 128MB device in the 256MB box!<p>If you order this product, check it as soon at it arrives and make sure you get what you pay for.  	0
I bought this about 1 year ago and have had to send the unit back 6 times so far. Every time I send it back it takes at least 4 weeks before it is returned to me. To date I have sent it back 3 times for the headphone jack (the ... headphones worked but the headphone socket has problems) and 3 times battery connection. The battery connections are very cheap and very fragile. Just putting the battery in could cause them to snap. It has now been over 2 months since I have sent it back and it looks like they have lost my unit. Now they refuse to refund me as I have had it for too long. I have notified the FTC (US consumer protection as far as I can figure out).<p>The menu system is NOT user-friendly, it regularly freezes or pauses even when just walking with it. The headphones are very cheap (as mentioned). If I could give it negative stars I would, it is a zero out of ten, a zero out of a google. Don't waste your money on this! Burn it,it would bemore interesting and giveyou more gratification.  	0
It's cool and small  	1
Since I bought this Creative Media Player I have nothing bad to say about it. First of all the sound quality is wonderful. Sounds just as good as my stereo, maybe even better. The removable battery is cool and so easy to replace, plus placing songs in this thing is so easy. And you don't even need to load the software into your computer. All that you need in a media player. But the software that does come with it is cool. You can rip an entire cd right into it without having to go into your computer. Plus you can lower the compression rating all the way down to 48 kbs. Works great with Napster and Rhapsody...no problems.....well just one....battery lasts about 4-6 hrs on a full charge...otherwise it's great...even plays movies too...still haven't figured that one out yet...I'm just a novice so when I do you better believe I'm gonna put a movie in this thing. One other thing...there's an a/v jack so you can plug it right into your tv or vcr...which is so cool I'm speechless. Can't wait for the new model which will hopefully have more GB's. 30 is just a little small for me. Highly recommended. Screw the ipod...get this instead...why pay 99 cents per song.   	1
Overall, this is a nice system.  The controls are not as intuitive as with other players; so if you hand this to someone else, they'll fumble with it for a little bit.  The sound quality is very good if you replace the supplied buds.  Battery life is adequate.  Screen resolution is fine for most purposes.  I would say that the average camera's LCD does a better job of displaying photos than the Gmini.  The issues I had was in getting the device to sync to my PC using Windows Media Player.  It would copy some songs, and then freeze in the middle of the next.  Disconnecting and reconnecting the device would help sometimes (but would leave multiple copies of the song on the Gmini occasionally).  Other times, it remained hung at that song.  Archos customer service suggested it was an issue with the USB and that I should upgrade my chipset firmware.  This was strange, considering other devices have no problems syncing.  On my own, I found that if i configured the Gmini as a hard drive, instead of a Windows device, the sync worked perfectly.  It appeared to sync slower, but at least it was reliable.  The other issue I noticed was that the song/artist names that were used in the Gmini was different from that shown in WMP.  For example, it would preface the song name with the track number (those downloaded from Yahoo! music).  Other times, it would refer to the artist as "Various Artists" when the artist name was correctly shown in WMP.  Deleting the song from the Gmini, updating the tag data and re-syncing fixed these issues.  However, it would be nice if the data was identical to WMP without the extra work.  Also, this is one of the few devices that displays the control screen on the TV, and not just the media.  However, the lack of a remote doesn't make this very useful.  To wrap up, this is a nice device with the given limitations.  I would still recommend it.     	1
I've owned my ipod Photo 30 GB for three years now, and the only problem I've really had has been with the original ear buds wearing out. I found OEM replacements on EBay for cheap:  they're good enough for me right now.  I am glad I purchased a neoprene case to protect the fragile little whizzer from the get go.  I have dropped it a few times, and the case saved its life.  	1
I have been playing mp3s since the first nomad was out. I have never had the problems transferring music to a player that the Clix has given me. I initially dragged and dropped (worked for the Iriver h10, creative zen 8 gb, creative zen m30) not for this player. Plays for shure my a**. These files are not recognized as music but go in a separate music folder under extras and browse (not easy to find). Read the manual. I need to use WMP 11. Easy enough. Installed it from the provided cd. synced music using that. Same location on the clix. Still not able to play it from the normal music playing functions. To the website. No answers and no way to contact technical support. I have not decided if I want to try the Iriver software. Will most likely just send it back. I like FM but this player Su***! I never thought I would consider the monopolistic policies of the Ipod but this may push me over the edge.  	0
Be careful when you open & close the battery lid, my son he is 12 and he broke that little thing on the lid on the first day he use it, luck it came with a plastic case, so it can still hold the lid. Other than that this is a great product.   	1
I've had my first Creative player, the Zen Xtra 60GB for 5 months now and I must say that I am incredibly happy with it.  I don't think that "Zip" is actually an Apple employee but worse yet a Mac geek (see book, "Cult of Mac").  The most ridiculous argument made by these types is with regard to the sound quality.  The ipod and ipod mini do most certainly have worse sound quality than just about any of their competitors.  Not only have I tested this myself, but anyone can read professional reviews and ratings for these players, where the apple inferiority in sound quality is always noted).  I just read a consumer reports roundup (either nov or oct 2004) of HD digital audio players and the ipod and ipod mini were each the WORST of their respective categories in sound quality.    I don't own it myself, but have a friend who does and can tell you that the Iriver ihp series absolutely blows away the ipod in many aspects, including sound quality.     As for this "imitator" label, lets all remember that apple was not even the second company to come out with this type of device (hard drive based digital audio player).  Creative was indeed the first with the Nomad. I owned an Archos jukebox well before the ipod was released (that model even has better sound quality than the ipod).  The ipod certainly was the smallest when it came out and continues to have a great interface but others have caught up.  Apple is actually the imitator in this regard although this is not well known becuase apple has the greater geek fanbase and marketing muscle to help obscure things.  Most people are not even aware that competing products exist.  What is apalling though, is that the advertising and the apple fanboy base have gone so far as to claim that the ipod has better sound quality.  I'm not just expressing my opinion, standards for measurement of sound quality exist and Apple's ipod's and ipod mini's do not compare favorably against the competition in this regard (do some research on Google, even on your mac).  Creative is the standard in computer audio hardware (the core elements of a digital audio player) and this helps them produce players with great sound.    No, I do not own a Zen micro and have never written a review for anything before owning the very item.  I was forced to do so here after noticing the utter insanity of Zip's comments.  If you want to just load up your player with Justin Timberlake, Creed or Brittney songs off of ITunes, perhaps the ipod is your best bet, just quit lecturing others.  Also, the backlit screen will reduce the battery life for any player, and the zen touch's battery life still kills that of the ipod (if you actually did own one).    Please, zip it good!   	1
I bought into the iPod despite concerns about being locked into a proprietary format.  This buy-in was based on the ecosystem of accessories available (and mainly options to integrate in my car).   I just "upgraded" to the 80GB iPod classic.  Everything I own that used to work with my previous 5G iPod video no longer works.  Anapod Explorer - BROKEN.  Never liked iTunes, and this was my solution.  It no longer works, which is, in Apple's Defense, Anapod's responsibility.  Fortunately the newest WinAmp integrates well (although it can't seem to get cover art right).  Still important to note that whatever file system changes were implemented here are likely to impact other products as well.  Auto OEM Adapter Kid - BROKEN.  My $600 OEM iPod car adapter no longer recognizes the iPod.  This is what I used my iPod for 90% of the time.  No auto connectivity, and this product is borderline worthless to me.  Logitech mm50 Speakers - PARTIALLY BROKEN.  Plays music but no longer charges the iPod.  How tough is it to make sure the newest iPods can still be charged with older accessories???  All in all, a MAJOR disappointment.  I'll be looking for a used or refurbished iPod video to replace this as soon as I get the chance.   	0
I never had to use customer support, that's why it gets four stars. Wow I have owned this wonderful toy for a year Never had a problem with. I have dropped it! It rebooted and rebuilt the library. It does so much. records, records your favorite radio programs too. (Think Felix Hernandez) Keeps data and photos (no Video) Create play lists whatever suits your mood. It's like walking around with your own theme music. An equalizer, choose your list random or planned. Play all or play some. Adjust the volume. Oh and another thing get your own headphones. Creative gives you an excellent product then gives you really cheap ear phones. But if your thinking of buying this at 8GB think twice and get more than 3 times as much space for the same price.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EA8U12/ref=cm_cr_asin_lnk/103-8786736-0310207">Creative Zen Sleek Photo 20 GB Multimedia Player (Aluminum/White)</a> Same price but get more, more more! A  little larger, same functions but at 20GB you'll lose your mind and make extensive use of Amazon's very varied music library.  	1
If you're a Mac user, this is a great product. It works wonderfully.<p>However, if you're a PC user, there are better products to use. I'll give it to Apple; the design of this product and the very intuitive UI are very strong points. In fact, those were what won me over in the first place. I brought it home, and tried to get it to work for several hours (8-10) without progress. I kept getting errors, and eventually called Apple's tech support, which were VERY professional and helpful. Turns out, though, that the iPod didn't work with my firewire card. So I bought the one they recommended, and still ran into problems. So I brought it back to the store and exchanged it for the Creative Zen, 20 GB USB 2.0 version, and it's way better. The sound has less noise, the battery life is almost DOUBLE the iPod's, and has almost all the features of the iPod (it's also got more space).<p>So, in short, for PC users, the Creative Zens are so much better, if a little more lacking in style.  	0
I purchased this 3 months ago and have been using it nonstop since. Unfortunately, after dropping it the thing no longer works, so it isn't very sturdy. The screen is bigger and it is much more watchable than the video iPod. One thing that really sucked about it (besides breaking down on me) was that the mp3 part of it was annoying. If you were listening to music and then watched a video, when you went back to pick up listening to your music you would have to start completely over in your playlist or annoyingly have to scroll down until you found your place.  Anyways, overall I loved this thing while it worked, but definitely won't be buying another one! I don't want to spend $200 bucks on something that just breaks so easily.  	0
I have had my Arhos GMini 402 for about a month, and I absolutely LOVE it! It is one of the most versatile devices I have ever owned, and it beats the pants off of ipod! From the moment I turned on the Gmini, it was near perfect. I love the fact that I can use it for video, music, pictures, games, as a voice recorder (great for a college student!), and as a portable hard drive. I also use it in my car - it works flawlessly when used with an FM transmitter, and I always have my music with me! The earbuds that come standard are great and have good sound quality, and I love the volume adjuster right on the cord, it is a really handy feature. I had read that the navigation was tough to use on this, but it only took playing with it for an hour or so to get the navigation down, It is not quite as easy as the click wheel, but it is not hard to use at all. Also, I love the fact that you can hook it up to your computer as a removable disk drive and just drag and drop your music and photos. The only thing that I would change is that if I had to purchase it over again, I would spend the extra money to get the version with the digital camera and camcorder in it. I have absolutely no complaints about the Gmini! It is awesome, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality media player that outshines ipod by far!  	1
I Love my new Samsung MP3 player, I haven't put very many songs on it yet but so far so good. It has vibrant colors and a lot of different features. The navigation is pretty easy to understand and get used to. And its so easy to personalize by putting videos or pictures etc. It's definetly different from an Ipod in a good way. If you don't want to follow the crowd but still want something reliable than this is the perfect product.   	1
I think people are just too hard on the reviews.    If you ask me, I think this is a GREAT deal. It's small, light weight, has a lcd screen, scrolling capabilities, and the sound is GREAT.   People are just stupid when it comes to writing crap. I got mine from wal-mart.  I think it's a GREAT deal.  Now, i'm sure there is much better ones out there.. but for the price this will do me just fine.    I haven't had a problem with it, and the transferring speeds DO NOT take a minute.  I loaded 300 songs in less than 10 minutes.  how fast do you want it? honestly?  The storage capacity is great too, i think they are stretching the 1000 songs u can put on, but even still you can put over 700 on it easily. and you dont need more. If you are looking for that, then u may as well get a ipod as they are made for storage.  It tells you ON THE BOX to use windows media player to sync your songs.. that is what i used and i didn't have a single problem minus one or two songs couldn't convert. but i EASILY fixed that by downloading it again.    The battery life lasts for about 5-6 hours, depending on what your features you have turned on.  for example... if you have the LCD screen on all the time then obviously it is going to drain the battery faster. they say it could last 10 hours, i dont see that, but maybe, if you have the sound turned low, no lcd.. then.... maaaaybe...  Features on this are good, has a bass boost, 5 equalizer presets, the LCD screen is a great feature. And it has a mic built in which works great, if you need to record something than this would work great for it. the mic will pick up even the quiet sounds.  sometimes a bit too much. There is a couple other features that you can look into by reading.  All in all, the product i think is great, i almost wnat to give it a 5 out of 5, but again, im sure there is better ones out there.. but just not at this price.  	1
I don't know why people were annoyed with this MP3 player. It has simple instructions to follow, and only 6 steps to do everything. It was easy to intall the program for it, and it transferred my music to the program, which was awsome. It was really easy to transfer my music into it, and it lets you make your own playlists, then transfer them, which is wonderful. It's also great that you don't have to plug it in, you just have to change the battery, which is faster and makes the MP3 last longer. I love that it's a sony too, so I know it'll last a long time. In short, it's a great MP3 player!   	1
The Archos AV 700 100GB Mobile Digital Video Recorder is THE sleeper gadget of the last two years! After two months of use after buying this item I have come to the conclusion that 95% of the so called "Cons" relating to this device are due to people NOT reading the instruction manual, or watching the instructional videos on the Archos AV 700 itself. The other 5% is from people who complain about everything that is not 100% perfect.       As far as putting your music on your Archos goes...nothing is easier. Syncing music is a snap with the Archos AV 700. Windows will know everything to do about a second after you plug the Archos AV 700 into the USB port on your computer. Contrary to popular belief the Archos AV 700 IS compatible with iTunes. You have to plug the Archos AV 700 into an Apple computer however. If you have iTunes on a windows machine I don't think it will work, but I am working on finding a way to do it. It sorts all your music just like it was on Windows media player and displays Album art work too, if available for your song. The best part of the Archos AV 700 is the music quality..... awesome!!! I used the same earbuds on my lap top to listen to music as I did with my Archos and I am hearing sounds and instruments I've never heard in some of my songs before. Archos's music quality has always been the best out there. Storing your pictures is just as easy as moving music over. I have always wanted an Archos device ever since a co-worker showed me one of there older Mp3 players that had a 60GB Hard drive in it when Apple was still at 5GB and 10GB.The sound quality and ease of use was there then and it is here now in their products.      The problems for most people come with copying DVDs and other movie formats to your AV 700. I transfered my first movie   right after I gave the unit it's first battery charge. (which you must do, it is good for the life of your battery) It took me about a half hour to hook up the TV Pod, but most of that time was spent pulling my 350lb. T.V. out from the wall to hook up the cords. The best part about the T.V. pod is after you hook it up you can leave it there for as long as you want without a problem.       The video quality problem is solved by recording with an S-video cable, (I know there isn't one included in the box, but at the price you're paying for the AV 700 a 30.00 S-video cable shouldn't break you. If it does then you shouldn't be buying this item), setting the bitrate at a high level between 1500 kp/s to 2500kp/s (I recomend 2500)helps a lot, and looking on the back of your DVD you are transfering and looking to see what format the movie is displayed in (4:3 16:9 etc...) and setting the Archos to match. Those settings are found on the programing screen which comes up after you click on the Videocorder icon. It also displays when the AV 700 is connected to the TV pod with the TV on. You just scroll down using the  directional pad on the right side of the device, and use the L R on the directional pad to change the values on the settings.       I don't recommend movies that take place mostly in the dark like Underworld, episodes of the X Files, Batman, etc... because the dark parts don't do well on a small LCD screen even if it is 7" big. That is the only downside I have found. You won't get as many movies stored by increasing the bitrate, but I have 6GB of music stored plus 10 full DVD movies stored at full bitrate, and I still have 80+ GB of memory left. The battery life is great even with movies playing. The complaints I have seen about it running hot are as far as I have seen unfounded. Any device from laptops to portable CD players will run a little warm or hot if it's AC adapter is plugged in while it is being used. I have found that my Archos gets a little warm but not hot. The key is to set the LCD screen to shut off after a few seconds when transfering movies, or when the screen isn't being used like when playing music. The Archos will shut the screen off during music play to save energy and screen life, but it depends on what your screen shut off setting is at. That will keep it running mildly warm. You must have the device plugged in however, when transfering movies, or syncing music.       I have had no problems with the issues I have heard about dealing with things like: LCD screen freezing up, The "poor" video quality, which can be adjusted, The so-called un-user friendly buttons and interface are complaints from people who can't hook up their own entertainment systems, or have to have Best Buy install their spyware or anti-virus software because they can't do it themselves. This is a device for early adopters of new technology, People who mess with the settings on their computers/cell phones/DVD players to better fit their likes and dislikes, can hook up their own DVD/DVR/VCR/change their own oil/swap out an old hard drive or memory for new ones. If you want your choices made for you.....buy something else cheaper and more boring. If you want something that does what it says and  will casue everyone to say "what's that"? "Where did you get that?!" then get the Archos AV 700 100GB! It is the Ferrari/Aston Martin/Lambo/Audi of the digital world. Creative/Rio/SanDisk/ are the Chevy/Ford/Dodge/Kia of the digital world.       The big question everyone asks themselves these days seems to be "Is it better than the iPod"? Yes and No Why? Well it is better due to the fact that instead of downloading Battlestar Gallactica through iTunes I can transfer my first season  set on DVD to a device that has a seven inch screen on it to view the hot number 10 and Starbuck!, It has a 100GB hard drive!!!, the music quality is better than iPod!        It isn't better due to the fact iPod has a lot of TV shows  and videos you can download from iTunes, the amount of accessories doesn't compare at all, the iPod does fit in your pocket.        I am planning on getting a 60GB iPod video later this year for the TV downloads and use with working out. My Archos is great but with a seven inch screen it makes it hard to run/jog with :)                       It comes down to what you need. The Archos AV 700 ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you have a working brain you will love it!          	1
If you, like me, have tons of music in your iTunes, you may be wondering: "Is this iPod going to be enough to help me carry all the music I want?" The answer is "it depends". If you want to carry literally ALL your music, bear in mind this unit will hold on average about 1,500 tunes. So you may run out of space well before you get half your collection into it.   However, if you are objective about it, and look into how often you actually listen to ALL your music, you will realize (like I did), that this iPod Mini (Silver or not) will more than serve your purposes. With this said, everything about it is perfectly balanced. The sound is fine (not studio quality, but it's very good, anyway). The interface is impeccable: incredibly easy to learn and use. The design is... well, Apple at its best! And it's light and highly portable.  The only downside are the covers for the earbuds, which I lost within a couple of days of starting to use it, but in all honesty the plain earbuds with no cover don't bother me. I may get myself a new pair of earbuds in the future, but for now, not even this I find to be a problem with the unit. So, if you are still wondering what do I recommend you to do: get yourself one of these, and you will be able to take your music with you all day long wherever you go, and be happy with your investment.  	1
Sometime in the last few months, IRiver has issued firmware upgrades that permit the user to select USB Mass Storage (UMS) firmware or Microsoft's Media Transfer Protocol (MPS).  Initially, the firmware only supported MPS and that ment using Windows Media Player 10 on a WinXP system to syncronize files between the PC and the T30.  If you have ever used Windows Media Player 10, then you know already how difficult and peculiar that software can be.  IRiver listened to its customers and finally released firmware for both UMS and MPS users.  With UMS, its drag and drop just like my other MP3 player.  Using UMS is liberating to say the least.  I guess someone likes MPS, perhaps the marketing guys at MS.   Overall, with the new firmware, its a very decent MP3 player with very good battery life. Anyway, thought you might want to know.   	1
I bought this instrument and it was spoilt within 2 months.The navigation to songs isnt user friendly.Even though I charge the battery completely, the instrument turns off abruptly.Sometimes it never goes on.Tried resetting it, charging it..nothing works.I am not sure whether its a defect with the instrument or the product, but would never go for it again.  	0
I purchased the iRiver PMC120 on 12/12/07 and gave it to my grandson as an early Christmas gift on 12/21/07.  On 12/23/07, the screen quit working and the inner screen has the appearance of being broken; however, there is no damage to the outer screen or any other part of the PMC and no reason to suspect that the PMC was abused.  I have returned it to iRiver, as instructed, and am awaiting their response.  Needless to say, I am not impressed with the product at this time and have not yet formed an opinion about iRiver's service since they were closed when the situation occurred, I was only able to initiate proceedings after January 2, 2008 and the issue is currently unresolved.  	0
When I saw this item I liked the idea having 20GB at my disposal.  Some people have complained about the controls on this is kind of hard to master.  I had no problems figuring out the buttons on the player itself.  When I ordered this, I was really hoping it had the "drag and drop" feature like many Creative MP3 players have.  This one doesn't.  You have to install software to use it.  Here's the problems:  I tried installing it on my PC.  It installed with no problem.  However, the program WILL NOT recognize the device is plugged in.  I went to the Creative Support sight, no contact numbers.  Just a email service.  Got their email back, did everything on the list.  Still doesn't work.  SO, I tried installing it on my laptop, the software wouldn't even install.  Just gave me an error message.  Once again, I have sent an email to Creative.  This is the 3rd day I've had this MP3 Player.  So far, all I've gotten out it is that I have a wonderful silver colored $180 dollar paper weight.  Needless to say, if these software issues don't resolve quickly, I am returning this item and getting an MP3 player that may have less memory, but DEFINATELY has the drag and drop feature.    	0
I'll need some self contro to stay polite, to write this review. I bought mine in november, but after one months the device refuse to work anymore, for no reason there was no way to switch it on anymore. During this first month, I won't say that was the perfect MP3 juke box... It bugged at least twice a week, in a way that sometimes I don't know why but I have till the battery was flat to restart it! But for that I was lucky cause the autonomy is far from the constructor datas, the most I was abble to use it was suring maybe 6 sometimes 7 hours... Otherwise I was slow to load the menu play a song or just respond to single command, the sound  wasn't really great, very flat even with the personalized equalizer... Oh I forget to mention the picture, I was only able once to load picture on it, and then never again, I try everything even restore all the factory parameter and delete all my music there was no way!!! So I was happy to contract the extra warranty, best buy give me a new one, my first surprise was that I didn't find the radio on the menu there wasn't any way to turn the radio on, but I didn't really care about the radio... So my new one was just like the old one, same battery autonomy, same weak and flat sound, same bug, but at least it worked for more than a months this time!!! Now it just died again, for no reason??? I'm glad to read other review like this one it means that's not my karma fault!! Just Philips... I came to best buy again, they proposed me to change it, but there was NO WAY!!! So I choose another brand, I hope that ipod will works better, and plus the new one is thinner, so I'll see!  	0
I am Very satisfied with the product and as always the service of amazon was excellent, the only disadvantage was that during the use the cable of the earpieces brokes and is only working one of the exits, by the others the product as equipment surpasses the expectations with the handling of the archives, the sport fusions and FM radio with the recording by several hours, very useful for the interest programs.  	1
I have owned Iriver machines since the late 1990s/early 2000s and I must say I have always been pleased. After owning a small 512MB MP3 player for a number of years I figured it was time for a replacement. So I figured I would list some Pros and Cons to this little machine.  Pros:  1. It costs a lot less than most MP3 players in its class, in addition it is a great value compared to most 5GB and 6GB MP3 players, this DOES have a 20GB capacity.  2. This MP3 Player plays all types of music (WMAs and WAVs to MP3s)and can do playlists you make on Windows Media Player.  3. It has many features you don't usually find; it can do picture shows, has a radio (where you can also pre-set your favorite stations), can record, read text files, has a clock/timer/and alarm.  4. You can customize the way you listen to the music. It has shuffle function, a number of ways the sound comes across (From Hard Rock to Rap).  Cons:  1. I had a few problems uploading music from the computer onto the device. For instance I would recieve an error message in addition it would somtimes freeze and I would have to restard Windows Media Player in addition to the player.  2. The player occasionally freezes and needs to be restarted using a paper clip through the little button on the top of the device. I have had this happen a few times and its a bit annoying.  3. This is a minor problem but if you download albums that are called the "Greatest Hits" the player will mesh them together (no matter if they are by Blondie or ZZ Top).  	1
My irrational desire to possess a tiny movie playing gadget eventually led me to buy the 4GB Creative Zen V.  Of the video MP3 players available on Amazon, it seemed to have the fewest negative reviews.  Other video MP3 players made by different companies tended to die quickly and could not be revived or fixed.  I've owned mine for about 3 months and it's still working.  I'm generally happy with it.  The positive:  -The controls are pretty easy to manipulate.  The manual teaches you the basics and refers you to a website for the complete controls -The software seems to work well for organizing songs on the player and converting 30 minute video files to be played on the player -It's impressively tiny -Good color and picture on the screen and good sound on the audio  The negative: -While the player's flash memory is large enough to hold a full 2 hour movie and more, the conversion software can't seem to convert a video that is longer than about 30 minutes -This last point is sort of moot if you consider how rarely you'll actually be watching something longer than a few minutes on a 1 inch screen.  So, the tiny screen could be considered a negative when you realize the actual experience of watching a video.  If you've read this far, you may ask yourself if you really want a tiny video player.  I'm still charmed by this gadget, but I honestly never watch videos on it.  It's not often that a tiny video player is useful.  It's just kind of fun!  	1
Really happy with the Zen Micro.  I am using it with Napster To Go and have am thrilled.  The playback sound is great (with smart volume on) and it looks cool.    A few gripes: - As a previous reviewer stated, the battery life was short at first, but after a couple full discharges - I'm getting at least 10 hours of music per charge. - The touchpad is WAY TOO SENSITIVE!  I have to lock it when I do not want to use the controls (and its on low sensitivity). - No accessories.  I can't find a holster/clip for this thing for use when exercising.  You'd think there would be tons out there....go figure. - Creative Media software is marginal. - it's the same toilet-white as an iPod on the sides and back.  All things being equal, I'd buy it again.  	1
This item had a very good price and my expectations were based on what information I read about it, but on receiving the item and attempting to use it, I found the instructions were not at all helpful.  I was unable to make it work.  So it sits in a drawer for now.  I feel my money was wasted on this item..not because the item was not a good piece of technology, but because I did not recieve instructions on it's use that made sense.  	0
Ups: - Incredibly small (excellent for going to the gym with, or just carrying in your pocket) - Massive storage - Sleek design (and it's shiny! A big plus if you're easily amused like me) - FM tuner and line in (cables included) can be recorded directly to device's memory - Microphone (a nice little feature for recording professor's lectures or anything else you may want to record) - Can also be used as a portable storage device - Music files can be easily organized into folders which can be easily scrolled/skipped/selected on the device's cool blue back lit LCD display and ingenious scrolling wheel - No need to install anything on your computer if you're using XP (and 2000 I hear), simple "drag and drop" interface - Screen can be flipped upside down for left-handed users - Has an equalizer that you can either customize or choose from the one of the 4 presets - Surprisingly good sound, even with the included ear-buds - Short of maybe an ipod (which, might I mention, has no line-in recording, no 15 hour battery life (which is super cheap to replace, unlike the $100 ipod battery), no built in fm tuner, no microphone, and is no where near as small or light as this thing) the best mp3 player out there you can buy.   Downs: - When the backlight is on, there is this really annoying buzzing sound - Songs within a folder cannot be "jumped" to, you have to scroll through the entire list (a price you pay for the player's portability and thus lack of buttons) - The battery cover has this shoddy little plastic nub that holds it in place...I'm constantly afraid of breaking it - This model (512mb model) will be obsolete in a short while (go figure....) because creative is releasing a 1GB version soon (will cost you about 200 bucks), but if you're like me, and can't wait, go ahead and buy this sucker, you wont be disappointed - When you record things using the microphone (I use it to record my o-chem and molecular bio. Lectures sitting about 10-12 feet away from my professors) you have to turn the volume up to max to hear anything during play back (or you can do what I do, transfer it to your computer and use it to amplify the sound). - The ear-buds keep falling out when I'm running - A little pricy, I think closer to 90-100 would have been a fairer price (if u strongly think this too, wait about a month or so, the prices on these things are always dropping) - If you get a dark color (I have the black), be prepared to constantly find your fingerprints all over the plastic case (white looks nice too ;-)) - It comes in a package that is impossible to open, some kind of super-metal/plastic-alloy-crap that you have to use titanium scissors to open (maybe I'm just mad because I cut myself while opening it...but hey, the loss of blood was justified)  On a scale of 1 to 10 - 9.6  	1
It seems that Jet Audio may have spammed the jet audio reviews with "quick delivery" items.  I've been waiting 2+ weeks for the Cowon A2 after ordering from Jet.  And getting through to customer service...grab a snickers...  UPDATE:  Dec 14, 2006  Well, we did finally receive the Unit about 3 weeks later than expected...but at least it did arrive!    As for the A2. It's a gem.  Bright, crisp screen and powerful sound output when played through car stereo.  The other reviewers have summed things up well (multi file format support is so nice).  The A2 is highly recommended...   	0
I have owned three SanDisk Sansa M240 models that store 1GB. The first one I purchased with a in store warranty, but the player did not work right out of the box. So I took It back and got a second Sansa which developed an intermittent short within two months causing sound quality to diminish significantly. I took the second Sansa back and cashed in my warranty on a third SanDisk Sansa m240 1GB along with buying a second in store warranty. In two months my third SanDisk Sansa m240 developed the same intermittent short. I'll cash in my warranty on a different player this time.  	0
I have had my player for a little over year now, and I like it.   But what I want to tell you about is it's durability.   I have dropped my mp3player, and all the normal things to abuse it.   But two nights ago I dropped it in a cup of iced tea.    I got it out, got the battery out, and blew on both the player and battery it to dry them.   The music stored on it still played, and after one day of drying out, the radio works as well.  That's what I wanted to say.  	1
I've had the YP-MT6X for two months, and I've already had to get one unit replaced because it would no longer power up after a firmware upgrade.  I had great hopes for this player because of its small size and the features that is has.  The problem is that this device seems to be pretty buggy.  The biggest problem is that the player will fail to see many of the songs that I copy to it (either from Windows Media Player's "Sync" function, or simply by dragging and dropping folders of music onto it).  After copying music to the device, and then powering up the mp3 player, the player will simply not see some of the songs.  If I navigate to the folders where the missing files should be, the player simply displays a message that says "No Entry".  I know the files are there because when I plug the device into a computer, windows can see all of the music files without any problems.  Both YP-MT6X's that I had did this.  The first player I had died when I tried to "upgrade" the firmware to 2.121 from samsung's website.  I used the firmware updater from samsung's site, and it said everything went fine, but after unplugging the player from my PC it would not power up.  I see at least one other reviewer has mentioned this problem as well, so I am not about to attempt this on my replacement player.  Samsung should not provide the 2.121 firmware on their website section for the MT6X if it causes your player not to power up after you install it!  So apparently I am stuck with the 1.111 version of the firmare that the unit had installed at the factory.  So in short I am left with a buggy player that can not see half of the files that I copy to it.  Changing the music on the player is extremely frustrating due to the "missing files" bugs.  I have not figured out a way around these problems, but I suspect it has something to do with a limit on the number of folders that can exist on the player because I can usually get the player to see the missing files by randomly moving them to different folders until the player finds all of the missing files.  Needless to say, this is a very frustrating process to go through every time I want to copy new music onto the player!  Perhaps if you can get a player with firmware 2.121 on it these issues do not exist, but I would definately recommend that you stay away from players with firmware 1.111.  You apparently can not upgrade the firmware on these units to 2.121, and they are very buggy!  	0
The title says it all, cheap headphones, wimp of a battery, difficulty in loading and actual use, and average sound makes this puppy a bad investment.  	0
Listen to Gadgetphile's review - I got this player today as a birthday gift, and I get the CANNOT PLAY message for every MP3 that I own (yes, OWN; I've never downloaded an illegal MP3). Evidently, the people who love this player use Sony's music service and ATRAC format. Thank goodness the giver kept the receipt; this player is going back to the store tomorrow. As usual, Sony is so obsessed with proprietary formats that they've ruined their chances in another lucrative market. This is the Betamax of MP3 players.  	0
I'd like to mention first my personal dislikes. One reviewer mentioned the user manual being thrown together. I couldn't agree more... The manual references a few features that I cannot seem to locate on the player and is also not very helpful in walking you through how to convert files to a compatible format that the player will play. New users could give the PMC a bad review due to the lack of the user friendliness manual. The USB plug cover is annoying as hell when trying to plug in the USB cable. You want to rip it off the player but then you risk getting dirt in the USB port. The power cord should have either had a 90* connector or the recepticle should have been located towards the bottom of the player. The player easily tips over because of this. Lastly, why is there no STOP button? iPods don't have this either but when I'm finished listening or watching I want to return to the main menu without what I was doing being paused in the background (you can actually see it). All of these grips are easily outweighed by the players other features though. On to the good parts... The video quality appears really good. The hard part is finding consistant information and software that will convert your DVD videos to WMV format. Video conversion all depends on the speed of your PC. My PC took about 1 hour to convert a 30 min episode of South Park to a WMV file and a few minutes to transfer the 177mb file to the PMC. JPEG picture quality is excellent. I resized all of my pics to the 320x240 screen size (keeping the aspect ratio). You can play any song(s) while the slideshow is playing too. The lack of slideshow control is a slight downside. One other feature I would have expected from a slightly bulky PMC is a FM tuner. Sometimes there are live events that you'd like to listen to without having to carry another device with you. Hopefully a future BIOS update will allow more options/flexability for the playlist, slideshow, etc... Price, definitely worth %50+/- of the MSRP of $499.99 ($250). I would have easily given 5 stars had the manual been a little more helpful and accurate and had the MSRP been in a more affordable/reasonable range. Oct 6, 2006 - After playing around with the device for several hours I have found some of the features listed in the manual. This doesn't mean that the manual is correct in the way it informs you how to access these features though. You can actually override the players conversion settings and transfer other file formats to the player to see if they will play. You still must use the Media Players sync feature to get an understandable meta tag for the files, or you just get an "unknown". You must use MP10 to access the players sync options. I'm not quite sure how the FM tuner add-on works since all ports (except USB) are output. After spending countless hours trying to find freeware that converts DVD files to WMV I find that I already had a program that would partially do this for me. Pinnacle Studio 9 has a VOB to Mpeg converter, I then let MP10 do its job converting to a compatible format. A 23 minute video is about 120MB. Not too bad.... My best advice to anyone who has purchased or is going to purchase this item is to use the left & right arrows on the navigation button. That's where the extra features are located. I still feel that a bios update will add many more features to this device that will continue to make this a better than iPod device with the exception of not interfacing with aftermarket car stereos.  	1
Run don't walk from this product.  It was heavily hyped this Christmas but despite it's strong features it does not work with XP.  Imagine getting a new computer loaded with XP and a cool MP3 player only to find that it doesn't even work with the O/S loaded on your machine.<p>RCA drops the ball by saying it's not sure if it will support XP.  What a cop-out.  Run don't walk from RCA PC related products.  They just don't get it...  	0
The CF receiver pins bent after light use. I also have a Dooin which is the same type of unit but without the display. I have used the Dooin for several years without a problem. When I email Customer Service Rico stated it used caused by user error. I do not understand how they could reach this decision without looking at the unit. I ask him to have Matt the owner contact me... he has not.  They do have warning about inserting the CF card. They have a bad design and they need to fix it.  This unit might be ok using SD or anything other than CF, but watch out if you need to deal with customer service.   	0
I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines.  The rewind bar doesn't work either!  you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.   	0
If you think the pictures and T.V. ads for this look impressive, wait until you actually get your hands on it. I got a nano just a couple of days ago after giving my old 15 gig iPod (the one with the row of 4 buttons above the scroll wheel) to my dad. This iPod is so incrediblely small and light weight. The screen is very bright and vibrant and pics look great on it. The sound quality is excellent as with all other iPods, and all of the great features, plus a couple new ones (stopwatch, world clock, screen lock), are here. The click wheel, although a little smaller than the ones on other iPods, is very accessable and easy to use. At 4 gb, you will probabally be able to get just over 1,000 songs on it, which is a very good ammount for the average person. All in all, this iPod is great and definitely has a "Wow Factor" that will facinate you when you see it.  Pros: *Amazingly Small and Lightweight *Great Sound Quality *Great Features That iPod's are Known For *Nice, Bright Color Screen  Cons: -Will not work with all older iPod accessories  	1
I bought one a couple of weeks ago on amazon and got a very very bad experience with creative zen nano. I had one sandisk e240 before and I have been using it for more than 6 months and I got no problem with it at all. It still looks like brand-new. Since my wife wants to have one mp3, I though we should try a different brand and then bought one creative zen nano. Nighmare follows. Zen nano is really like a small cheap gadget. The cons from my experience are 1) The battery cover broke within only two weeks.  2) The surface is easily scratchable.  3) No sleep timer included. 4) The lock function is build-in within the software, instead of a direct mechnical switch like in Sandisk. 5) The LCD window is too small. 6) The sound of pressing buttons is too loud and sounds like cheap toys.  A lot of people mention that the custom service of creative is very bad. This is not case for sandisk. The first mp3 I have is sandisk 1gb mp3 player (not e240 series). The firmware brokes once; I just send it back to sandisk and got replacement within 2 weeks without paying any fees. Although both brands are made in China, Sandisk obvisouly has much better design and quality control.  	0
I love my Pad. I don't understand why some are comparing this device to a laptop/desktop. Its like comparing a treo or blackberry to a pepper pad. My pepper allows me to easily sit outside/inside and do the things I need to do when NOT at my desktop. Its attractive, small, very portable and it works. The pad fills in a space that laptops and smartphones can't....more power than a PDA but bigger, less power than a Laptop/desktop but smaller. Oh and I also got my pad wet once...only to learn at that point that it is actually splash proof...phew. Try that with your dell :)  	1
This MP3 player ROCKS! And here's why: 1. It sounds great 2. It's the size of a book of matches and weighs like one ounce 3. It has a color screen 4. Has rechargeable battery 5. Is simple to use and navigate once you are familiar with it 6. No moving parts, it's a flash drive 7. No extra software required, just drag & drop in Windows, or Media Player. 8. It has a FM radio built in. The only downside to this player is the crappy headphones included. I bought some better headphones, and with the included belt clip, I'm all set for the gym. Ipod Shuffle eat your heart out.  	1
I've had this 1 year now. It's great for air trips. I watch a movie, then put on songs. I have about 10 movies, 80 pictures and 400 songs loaded. The batery lasts about 4 hours for video or 2 hours of video and 5 hours of music. I use DVDshrink (freeware) and CloneDVDmobile to copy movies to the viewer. It does occasionally lock up but if you remove the batery and reconnect it the veiwer always restarts. The fast forward and rewind are difficult, you don't see where you are while rewinding. Because the viewer has regular TV resolution the picture when plugged into a regular TV is amazing. This is a great way to carry several hours of movies and music and a great way to watch and listen to them.  	1
The service was outstanding from Amazon, could not ask for more.  In great anticipation, I openned the package to set up my new Palm Live Drive. It did not work from moment one.  The battery will not charge, can not keep the screen lite.  It has been a hastle for two days now.  I am sending it back to Palm.  It has been frustrating, did numerous resets (hard, soft, cradle in).  My excitment has been nothing but disappointment.  	0
Since the firts day I saw it, i knew it was going to be a great product. I just bought mine here on amazon.com!!!  What a terrific idea! I think it's going to be the standard for music, not only for the people that are  &quot;on-line&quot;but everybody as well. I highly recommend it!  	1
Plays ok, good tuner, but...  Trying to get an audio book loaded was a pain. First try, wound up with the mini chapters loaded in almost random order. Used another ripper, copied them to the player and it would not play the files. Loaded those files through their software and got everything in order, but it removed the names and changed the MP3s to their pet format. Should never buy a MP3 player from a company that sells CDs.    	0
This is a load of crap. I got it as a christmas present.. and now it's february.. so i've only had this thing for 3 months. Well, at first it was all right and all.. but now it's officially DEAD. I have yet to send it in to be repaired and i'm not sure if i want to considering my dad paid so much for this skimpy thing that fails to deliver after only 3 months. I get tired waiting for songs to upload and furthermore, the battery life drains so fast. i started out w/ an ok battery (the battery would go down one bar after about 30 songs) to battery life of an imposter duracell bunny (less than 20 songs and it's down one bar) well great, my ipod died completely when i tried to listen to it a few days ago. it's not responding to snything. i see some ppl think it's great and it has worked out well for them but i really think this is a hit-or-miss product. Either it works for you or it dies within a few months. I have heard other stories of people's ipod dying within a few months and even though there's a one-year warranty, the person still had to pay for some repairs. So buyers beware.. make sure you know what you're getting yourself into!<br>Edit: I got a replacement ipod... had to transfer all the songs over to it... moreover, it just died again. So this stupid thing has died TWICE in less than SIX MONTHS.  	0
I like almost everything about iPods, but I can not STAND having to use iTunes...it is a total pain in the behind...If Apple would allow the iPod to just look like a hard drive to my computer I would be all over this thing. I started with a 30 gig iRiver which I loved but out grew. Now I have an 80 gig Archos 504 which is good but a bit large.  When I first got my iRiver I used iTunes software and it drove me batty...Come on Apple!! Free up...let folks use iPods as little HD and you will lose your competitors but until then....  	0
What is everyone talking about? If they just read the manual they could work it better. The software for this player is not brilliant but it DOESN'T crash your computer... it depends if you're computer sucks. It: 1. Holds up to 13,000 songs and this theory is TRUE 2. Has more shuffle options than the I-Pod shuffle 3. Is the smallest mp3 player out there for it's memory 4. Has better sound quality than other players 5. Can search for songs by name of song, album and artist. Also searches by Genres and you can form groups. 6. Can have one playlist that holds 100 songs. 7. Is extremely small and good looking 8. The 7 line display is very clear and informative.  9. Many different sound options with an equaliser. So there.  	1
If you are looking for a DVR that you can use with your Home AV system and take on the road, save your money and do not buy this device.  The menuing system is HORRIBLE.  Why they invented button icons instead of using standard conventions is beyond me.  There should be one SELECT button, but there are several, depending upon which menu you are in.  Just changing the sound from headphones to internal speaker is difficult.  The internal speaker is OFF when it looks like it is on, and ON when it looks like it is off.  You must also keep movie file size around 1gb or the playback will only show up to that point!  Hooking it up to a home system works, but can be tricky depending upon the number of inputs you have on your home theater system.  It is a cool device, but the drawbacks make it not worth the price.  I'm a total techie, and this device stays in a drawer because it is just too difficult to work the device.    	0
"I originally bought a Cowan iAUDIO X5 30GB MP3 from Amazon. I wanted to return it, only so I can buy the larger GB60 unit, which I did buy. I liked the iAUDIO so much, I decided to keep both the 30GB and the 60BG units. I loaded the 30Gb with music, and gave it as a gift to my older brother. The reception is excellent. I can hear the bass and the cellos to perfection. It took a little learning for a neophyte to learn how to use it; but after it was loaded with music, I couldn't let go of either unit. It is a great product. I recommend it to all neophyte MP3 buyers" Henry J. Zeiter, M.D., F.A.C.S. Author, "From Lebanon to California," at Amazon  	1
I have had this player for just over two weeks now and have found it easy to use. Unlike what some other reviewers have said, the Napster software is not a must if you want to transfer music to this player. Windows Media Player 10 works just fine. The product manual from Samsung seems to be the cause of the confusion, since it does not do a good job of explaining this. Although the manual gives detailed instructions on how to sign up and use Napster to transfer music, it does not provide any details on how to use WMP 10. You can import your music into WMP 10 and use the Sync feature to upload music into this player - it works just fine.   The player supports Secure WMA and the line-in recording feature is useful to have, if you want to digitize music from your tape and LP collection. I have not yet attempted to import Playlists into the player via WMP 10, though but I have read at least one other review on this site that states that you need the Napster software to import playlists. Assuming this to be a limitation of the product (and not of WMP 10), it still deserves 4 stars, as the sound is excellent and overall, the product appears to be easy to use.   	1
After reading the reviews about the fraility of the battery cover, I took extra precaution when changing batteries.  I get about 50 hours out of each AA battery I use, and I use rechargeable batteries.  The FM radio function works great, and once you get used to the controls, they are as easy as the ipod I used to use.  The only tough part is deleting radio files that you accidentally record when you put the player in your pocket.  For the price, this is the best player I've ever owned.  	1
You HAVE to use their lousy SonicStage software to transfer songs to it. That is just stupid. Well, not just stupid, arrogant also.  I was attracted to this thing becasue of it's size, battery life (which is exaggerated by at least 50%), radio tuner, and most of all its support of AAC encoded files. Apple's products have no radio tuners, and if you've chosen AAC as your audio codec, you haven't been able to get a flash based player which will both play the radio and play your AAC files.  Kudos to Sony for allowing it to play AAC audio files, it's about time someone besides Apple implemented this MPEG standardized codec in their "MP3" players, but why force poorly written software (SonicStage) down our throats? Why force any software down our throats? With almost all flash based mp3 players you can just drag and drop your music files via your operating system; you just connect it as an external hard drive and drag and drop. Then also you can use them from Windows, Macs, Linux, whatever.  And why are they still pushing ATRAC codecs? It's a waste of their time and money, and the world does not need Sony trying to push its own proprietary codecs. It's by no means superior to the standardized MPEG AAC codec or Microsoft's proprietary (although basically free) WMA codecs. Dear Sony, your codec is not significant, it is not a player in the audio codec world, and the world is better off without you trying to push it on us. The same can be said about your other proprietary variations on standardized technologies, e.g. betamax and Memory Sticks. You just make the world more complicated, in the end you lose, and your market share goes to zero. (Although I did think MiniDiscs were a good idea.)  It's a good piece of hardware, but in order to use it you have to jump through Sony's hoops. Just say no.   	0
Zip it seems that you critisize the previous guy of being a creative employee because he likes it. On that basis it would seem that you are an Apple employee, next time do not open your mouth. As for me i think that this product is far better than the apple ipod mini although for it to take down the mini it must have a crack team of marketers to get the word out, other wise it will likely go unnoticed. For all those un biased about products you should find this a much better product than the ipod mini on many fronts.  NEW: It seems that amazon in an attempt to make a few more bucks has jacked the price up from the 250$ that it used to be to 280$. Dont buy here go to creatives web site and buy from them its cheaper and you wont get screwed by amazon. I still love this product and intend to buy it after a few reviews come out from respectable magazines like PCmag or someone like that but until then screw you amazon i hate you and you need to drop the price back down so this thing can compete with the ipod mini.   Even more NEW: Good job amazon you droped the price back down. Who's a good boy, thats right. goood boy.  	1
Sorry, the menu button on the player jammed after only 4-5 days of very occasional use! The style and functionality of this player is awesome but the buttons on it are tacky and wear out way to fast! As much as I want to keep or exchange it, I'm returning it and sticking to my screenless 2nd gen shuffle. The buttons on that feel much better and I guess I don't really need a screen because those usually distract me from actually listening to a song instead of constantly picking one to listen to!  	0
i saw it, read about it, thought it was everything i needed. Boy, was I wrong! This thing is...crap! When a song is playing, sometimes I want to switch to a new one. It's frozen up on me 3 times!! Then, I have to wait for the battery to run out, and then recharge. It takes forever! And every single time i recharge it, it runs out of power even faster than before.  The settings are so messed up! For some reason, all the songs kept switching around. I am the only one who messes with it. Turns out for some reason, it was put on shuffle mode! And the radio is so hard to figure out, you have to use the manual to get it! And the radio quality is horrible. The sound quality overall is bad too.   I bought this as a congratulations for finishing middle school with money my parents gave me. Now I am paying the consequences. I am earning to buy a new iPod nano.  DO NOT BUY THIS. I AM WARNING YOU!!! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT BUY THIS MP3 PLAYER, IF YOU EVEN CALL IT THAT!  I call it...a waste of my good money and crap.  	0
I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased the iRiver H10 but I was terribly WRONG!!!  I bought my wife and ipod for her birthday (which is awesome) after I bought the iRiver. I will be getting an ipod very soon.  Problems - The battery life is only about 2 days.  Which would not be a problem if the battery indicator actually indicated when the battery is getting low...nope, the display shows full bars and then with no warning it just shuts off and displays a battery dead sign.  - Downloading music is a hassle.  On several occasions I have had to wait while the music is uploaded and re-uploaded before I can add more music.  - Sometimes (actually a lot of times) it just doesn't work.  I will turn it on and it will just freeze up.  At this point you have to take the battery out and wait for it to initialize and hope that it works right.  - The charging system as a whole is sloppy and akward.  There is a 3 headed beast that should have been made into a simple input/output.  - There are several more issue about not being user friendly and other ways it will freeze up on you, while your in the middle of your workout but you get the point.  Get an ipod and be happy with life    	0
I've had my Rio for about 4 months.  The other day I went to download some songs to it, and now it says that it only has 16mb of memory.  I don't know what happened to it.<p>Also, the 32mb of memory is not enough if you're like me and use the player all day.  If I bought another mp3 player to replace this broken one, it would have to have at least 64 mb of memory.  I could fit a maximum of 8 songs on the Rio.  	0
According to many reviews, the Nomad II MG blows away all other portable MP3 players.  Sure, I'll buy that.  But compared to MP3 playback on my home computer, it sounds terrible.  It has a low frequency rumble that drowns out any quiet moments, even in high bitrate, LAME-encoded MP3s.  A friend of mine with the same model has confirmed this.  Furthermore, the sound reproduction seems to be a bit &quot;thinner&quot; than what I get with my home computer, even when using aftermarket, digital reference headphones.  (The headphones they provide are TERRIBLE.)  The interface on the Nomad is probably the clunkiest and most counterintuitive I've ever seen.  It's hard to pick the unit up without pressing a button (they're on the sides).  I've already accidentally deleted a song, and so has my girlfriend.  The included software is extremely unstable (under Win98).  I've had it crash many times just browsing available MP3s, and others have complained of this as well.  The software should simply be a conduit to the device, but the Creative people have tried to make it do too much, and they've made it very user unfriendly and filled it with bugs in the process.<p>I suppose the Nomad is decent for use during exercise or on the train, but if you consider yourself a semi-audiophile I recommend you do not buy this product.  Wait until the technology matures.  Most studies find that near CD-quality is about 256kbps.  The Nomad will only hold 30 minutes of music at this rate, and will reproduce it with distortion, all in a confusing little package.  I don't think that's worth [the price]; do you?  	0

[...] I ordered this as a Christmas present for my (then) 13 year old son who longed for "the competition" version of MP3.   The Rio Carbon 5GB was too much memory for the $$ to pass up. Although it's quite a bit larger in size, it's design is sleek, very "industrial" and my son LOVED it.  Still uses it DAILY and it's been 2 Christmases ago!  Felt secure in the reviews, felt secure w/ the guarantee and the company rating.  Mom scored big-time. :)  	1
This is my first MP3 player, I got it for Christmas.  This thing is so cool!  I put stock away after the store where I work closes a couple nights a week so it's great to just stick it in my pocket and put it on shuffle and I don't have to touch it the rest of the night!  Comes with a coupon for 5 free downloads at connect music store, at least mine did. (Remember to register your device with the store or else you can't put the songs you've downloaded onto your player!).  I'm online everynight so while I'm chatting with friends I'm always going through my CD's putting songs on it!  Songs don't skip, the battery lasts really long and then if it's plugged into the computer while you're loading songs onto it, it's charging anyways!  I love it!!  the only one thing I don't like, and it's just cuz I'm weird like this, is that I can't seem to find a way to alphabetize the songs on the player itself...I just do it myself when I'm putting songs on it...although there is probably a way to do it I just can't figure it out!  :P  	1
