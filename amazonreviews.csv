"I am comparing the Momentum 3 with Sony WH-1000XM3 that I also own. I am using Galaxy S10, Macbook Pro 2017, Tidal Hifi to test them.

Sound: It is definitely an upgrade from the Sony. Much better sound stage and warmer sound. Bass is a bit boosted but the phone app has EQ, so you can tune it the way you want. I noticed cracking/popping sound when I use it with Macbook pro. It pops for a few seconds for every song. No issue with my phone. Both MBP and GS10 are using APTX.

Noise cancelling: Very disappointing. It can block some fan/AC noise. But totally unable to block datacenter server noise. The Sony won by a mile.

Comfort: Material is premium. Clamming force is just about the right amount to keep it on my head securely. Heavier than Sony but not enough to bother me. I still give Sony a slight win in this department.

Portability: It does not fold flat like the Sony. So the carrying case is a lot bigger than Sony's. And the case is not hard enough to protect the headphones. And since it doesn't fold flat, you can't hang it around the neck. Sony +1.

Features: Connect 2 devices at once. This should be industry standard, but Sony can only do 1 at a time. Momentum 3 auto pause when you take off headphones, I love it. Physical buttons, I like it more than touch ear cups on the Sony.

Conclusion: I bought these headphones hoping to replace my Sony. But I think I can only use this in the office. Its difficult to carry around and noise cancelling is pretty useless. If I can only keep one pair, I will choose the Sony. One last thing, for $400, a pair of sound quality focus headphones don't have APTX-HD support? Come on, Sennheiser!",4
"An unbiased review that represents my search for a multipurpose high quality over the ear headphone.

See update at bottom of review

As a premise that there is no single headphone that works for everyone and every situation, no single item is perfect for everyone and everything. I have wireless earbuds for working out, the Jabra 65T active, and love the Jaybird Vista wireless for use when working long term use during the day. I also have a pair of Sony over the ear headphones, the WMH 900N for sound suppression when working outdoors.

I wanted improved sound and didn't need absolute noise cancellation for the loudest of environments. I was looking for good blue tooth sync without audio/video delay, and some sound isolation. Also, the need for Bluetooth 5 was a relative need in order to allow syncing to more than one device.

I did look at the Bose and the Sony WH1000XM3.

Here's my take:

Design:
I like the looks. They appeal to my industrial design concept that sleek and modern is not always the best. The exposed steel and wires is reminiscent of the traditional headphones. I think the style will stand the test of time. Bose and Sony are more streamlined, but the modernistic approach may appear dated in several years.

Controls:
I am not a Luddite, but I do not like touch control configurations. There is nothing like a physical button in increasing volume and the pause button. Even the Jabra and Jaybird wireless earbuds give tactile feedback with control. I just like buttons that I can feel and confirm, a positive click.

Battery life: Not the longest but I tied it for 19 hours during one measurement. That is more than enough. The USB-C is universal, and it charges from every source I plug in.

Bluetooth. There is absolutely no, none, nada, video to audio lag. When watching speaker audio and the headsets, the sound is simultaneous. Feel free to watch these with a TV and blue tooth stream. Just make certain that your Bluetooth transmitter has the most updated AptX support.

When turning on the headphones, it will announce simultaneous connections to up to two Bluetooth sources. One reviewer bemoaned the fact that the announcer only identifies them as ""phone one"" or ""phone two"". I don't find this an issue. I know phone one is my TV and phone two is my cell phone.

I have not measured the absolute blue tooth distance, but I can walk down a flight of stairs and go at least 30 feet without an issue.

Pause:
The pause when you tilt your head is annoying. When watching TV, it kept thinking I was trying to pause. I turned it off in the app.

App:
Not the best. After installing the App and syncing, it needed a firmware update that took 20 minutes. Then, the only way I could sync was to unpair the Bluetooth from my phone, uninstall the app, reinstall the app and re-sync. Then, everything was ok.
Any changes in the app such as equalizer or ANC settings are maintained in the headset even if the phone is not synced to the headsets.
I agree, the equalizer control is not intuitively easy, but it does the job and the neutral setting or default give great sound. As I noted, the setting is stored in the headset, not the phone so you don't need your phone to keep the settings.

ANC;
Not the best, but no intrusive. I find it great for office work and daily background noise. If you don't require absolute total isolation from a jet airplane, these will work.

ANC Off:
There is some isolation from the earphones. With ANC off, the sound is impressively wonderful. Crystal clear, special, dynamic. It does beat the Sony with ANC off. I felt the Sony had too much thumping or muffled bass boost.

Volume:
In my opinion, louder with less distortion than the Sony or Bose. The Sony and Bose have significant base distortion on max volume

Weight:
The Sony seems to be lighter and easier to wear long term. I'm no a fan of the Bose fit.
The Sennheiser are a little tighter than preferred when I got them out of the box. Easily fixed with some manual ""unbending"" of the band. The weight seems find for hour of listening and they feel better than the Bose. The Sony's are the best, but are also all plastic.

Problems:
The first pair I purchased had a ""white noise"" feedback in the left ear when place on ambient noise. It was intermittent but continued on and off each time I wore them. And, there was a crackling in the left ear. As if there was a connection issue. I returned them and the new set was perfect. Amazon returns are easy.
The app is a little cumbersome on first set up. You have to install it, connect, get the firmware. Then, in my case, I had to uninstall the paring and app and reinstall to make it reconnect. However, now all is good.
Initially the headband was slightly tight. It needed a little tweaking. This is not a big deal

What would be ideal would be the Sony weight, the Sennheiser sound and appearance, the Bose quality and ease of support.(there are a lot of Bose stores in the mall). Since there is no single perfect headphone, like looking for the perfect laptop, there are always slight compromises.

Overall:
If you want Bluetooth 5 connection, great sound, good ANC and range, good battery and classic styling, go no further. Yes, they won't fold into a slim aerodynamic sandwich, but they give crystal clear sound and perfect video lip sync and can be worn for hours.

Updated:
As much as I liked the sound and fit, I ended up returning the headphones due to a never ending problem of bluetooth disconnects and drops. While listening to music or a streaming video, the bluetooth would drop after 20 minutes of use. The only way to reconnect was to either switch the ANC off and on or turn the headphones off and try to reconnect.

I called Sennheiser and did a complete removal of all bluetooth devices on the transmitter, removed all bluetooth from my phone, uninstalled and reinstalled the app, reconnected the bluetooth link to the transmitter, and the problem continued. Once it occured, it would drop the signal about every 10 minutes..

I have connected Jabra Active 65T, Sony SH 1000 XM3, and Jaybird Vista without any issues or drops. I removed all bluetooth connections and have no extraneous sources of interference. Sennheiser told me that the bluetooth in the headphones was not acting correctly and they should be returned.

So, first set had a faulty left speaker.
The second set had faulty bluetooth.

Maybe it was bad luck....I loved the sound, the weight, the fit, the appearance. I just am left disappointed in the quality of the device. If you get a working model, they are great.",3
"I'm really bummed out about these. As soon as they were released, I ordered a pair. Build quality is top notch. Sound was really nice until I started hearing popping noises. Battery was stuck at 60% after being plugged in over night. The leather on the right earpad was scarred right out of the box. Too many issues for a $400 dollar pair of headphones. I ended up returning these. Hopefully they will iron out the kinks in the future. Until then I will still be searching for the ultimate headphones.",2
"Price - Both are currently $399USD at the time of this review.

Design - I slightly prefer the looks of the Bose while on my head. It’s more streamlined and minimalistic. The Sennheiser’s look more elegant with the steel and leather materials when off the head or when on the head from a side view. However, the exposed wiring looks kinda funky on the head from a front view (hence why none of the promo pics show the model wearing these headphones from a front view. They’re always looking towards the side.) Both are built well with no worries that one will break easily from normal usage. The Momentum’s takes the slight edge here in overall build quality because of the authentic leather on the ear-pads and headband. The Bose can fold flat which results in a much smaller profile when stowed away in its hard shell carrying case. The Sennheiser’s can also fold, but not flat. Sennheiser’s carrying case is about twice the thickness of the Bose and it’s not a hard shell material so the Sennheiser’s face a higher chance of crush damage while being in your bag.

Controls - Bose went with touch controls while Sennheiser retained the tried and true button configurations. Both headphones allow controls of your volume, play and pause media and call accept, hang up and hold. Both thankfully have a dedicated voice assistant button however, the Bose allows for always on and listening Alexa. Both can toggle between ANC modes, but the Bose allows for 3 different ANC preset switching out of the 11 different options while the Sennheiser’s allow for only ANC on or off and ambient mode. The Bose surprisingly doesn’t allow you to turn off the ANC from the headphone. In order to turn off the ANC on the Bose, you have to do that from the app. The touch controls on the Bose is pretty responsive and I don’t really have issues with it. Time will tell if they suffer the same fate with random triggers and inputs when in cold temperatures like the Sony WH1000Xm3. The button controls on the Sennheiser’s is tactile and works as it should. So it really depends if you prefer buttons or touch controls here.

Comfort - I prefer the Sennheiser slightly here. It’s lighter and just hugs my head with enough pressure to not fall off with any sudden head movements. The ear-pads opening is generous and allows my ears to go in all the way and not be clamped down. The Bose is quite comfortable but they clamp a little harder on my head. I can wear both for 2 hours straight but the Sennheiser’s just leaves my head not feeling as fatigued.

Battery Life - Bose takes the cake here. Longer 20 hour battery vs. the Sennheiser’s 17 hours. Also, from a quick 10 minute charge the Bose can receive a longer charge at 3 hours vs the Sennheiser’s 1.5 hours. Both charge via USB-C.

Bluetooth - Sennheiser’s take the cake here in terms of codec support. NFC support is on the Sennheiser’s but not the Bose. Sennheiser also support AptX-LL which is great for those who might want to play video games if they have a AptX-LL equipped receiver or device. In terms of YouTube, Netflix and Hulu, I haven’t detected any lip sync issues while watching videos on either pair of headphones. Both support AAC and SBC, but the Bose does not support AptX. Connectivity and range has been pretty great on both and I haven’t had any crazy issues while using both on the bus, subway, walking through NYC, at the office and at home. Both support 2 device connections simultaneously. I prefer the Bose implementation because it switches between devices more seamlessly in my experience and the voice prompts tells you the name of the device it is connected to or has disconnected from. The Sennheiser’s voice prompt just says “phone 1 connected/disconnected” or “phone 2 connected/disconnected” which isn’t really helpful if you’re like me and have a desk with a MacBook Pro, iPad Pro and iPhone XS Max on it. Both can conveniently be put into pairing mode from one of the buttons on the control side of the headphone’s ear-cups.

Call quality - Bose is still number 1 here. Callers continue to tell me they can hear my clearly despite me being right next to a bus engine on my commute to work. Meanwhile on the Sennheiser’s, callers said they can hear the bus engine and I need to speaker up louder in the same environment, but they can still hear me unlike the Sony WH1000Xm3 which is completely horrible in these situations. Both perform exceptionally well when giving commands to Siri or Google Assistant. If you’re in a quiet to moderately loud environment, they’re both gonna do well in calls. The Bose just sets itself apart in noisy environments due to the excellent microphone array and the ability to cancel out background noises. Both have a convenient feature to mute your microphone while on the call using the voice control button on the Bose and the volume down button on the Sennheiser’s.

Features - Both do the basics for a 2019 premium ANC headphone. Bose has significantly more control over its ANC system (albeit a bit overkill). The Bose has 11 presets with 0 being ambient aware mode and 10 being maximum noise cancelling. Also, on the Bose there’s a button to toggle between 3 saved ANC presets from the app which leverages on the fly adaptation to your environment. Sennheiser’s approach is to either have the ANC on at max intensity or on with wind reduction or lower cabin pressure, ANC off or transparency/ambient mode with the ability to have audio play as well or not. The ambient mode is slightly superior on the Bose. The Bose makes your ambient environment sound like you don’t have headphones on and it comes off as very natural. The Sennheiser’s sound slightly digital but very good nonetheless. As for noise cancelling, Bose is easily superior in terms of suppressing the noises around you. With the Sennheiser’s, I can still hear a decent amount of what’s going on around me while I’m commuting or walking through the city. With the Bose, the world literally melts away when the noise canceling is engaged and I can faintly hear what’s going on around me. When music is playing for the most part they will both block out everything around you typical in a commuting situation unless you listen at low volumes or there’s a quiet passage in the music or media in which the Sennheiser’s weaker ANC will cause loud outside noise to seep in.

Sound - I enjoy listening to both. The device I used is my MacBook Pro streaming AptX to the Sennheiser’s and AAC to the Bose. The Sennheiser is the more bass heavy, richer, spacious and warmer sounding of the two. The Bose is very balanced and neutral to my ears. Very high levels of clarity and detail can be heard on both sets, but the Sennheiser’s slightly edges the Bose in immediate detail and clarity. Soundstage is superior on the Sennheiser’s whereas everything just has this multidimensional and spacious presentation. The music sounds more like a live performance on Sennheiser’s as opposed to listening in a studio like on the Bose. The separation of the instruments within the music is great on both, but the Bose sounds more dynamically compressed in comparison to the Sennheiser. The superior dynamics of the Sennheiser’s aides in the ability to replicate a more convincing sense of space between instruments. The Sennheiser’s bass is very powerful and well extended. It’s a healthy bass boost but it is centered in the sub-bass region which mitigates bass bleed into the midrange. The Bose has a more neutral bass that can bottom out and distort when pushed to high volumes. The Sony WH1000Xm3 in comparison has a bass boost mostly in the upper and mid bass which blooms over into the mids and makes them sound boomy overall. The Sennheiser’s get louder than the Bose and Sony’s and don’t distort at max volume which is a plus if you like to listen at those volumes. The Bose and Sony’s at max volume can distort on some tracks regardless if ANC is on or off. No, I don’t believe in burn-in (If you’re getting ready to say I didn’t have the Sennheiser’s long enough). I’ve listened to countless brand new headphones and a highly used one of the same model and they always sound and measure the exact same.

Conclusion - The Sennheiser’s have a special spot in my collection even though compared to the Bose, It performs worse overall in ANC performance, isn’t as comfortable to my head, has a worse overall battery performance, looks elegant but a bit uglier in my opinion than the streamlined look of the Bose, doesn’t perform as well for calls, has less overall controllability from the headphones and it’s bulkier to carry around due to the much larger case that provides less protection than the Bose.

Why?

Because despite all that it still does the essentials required from a modern day 2019 pair of ANC wireless headphones all while packing the best sound experience in this category to my ears.

Great job Sennheiser. You’ve managed to incorporate a better microphone for voice pickup and 2 device Bluetooth connectivity (something the overrated Sony WH1000Xm3 couldn’t do), a decent and controllable ANC with ambient modes and good comfort alongside your signature sound. Color me impressed!",4
"To give some perspective, I’m the type of consumer who owns a collection of various headphone types from the Shure SE 215 to the SE846 to the legendary Sony MDR-XB90EX. I have the Bose QC35s, beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, a few Etymotic Research and Grados for critical listening and a Sennheiser HD 650. I like music a lot as it is what grounds me.

Nevertheless these Sennheiser Momentum‘s sounded amazing and were loud for Bluetooth headphones but their design and features cripple them.

Call quality is not good. It’s a step above terrible which isn’t saying much.

The software and EQ is terrible to use. It’s not intuitive and prevents the user from granular controls. Each edit affects multiple frequencies which makes the app just provoking to use.

Noise Canceling is terrible, mediocre at best.

Comfort is lacking (at least for me) these are heavy and you start to notice the weight after some time.

Mechanics of adjusting the headband is terrible and I found myself continuously making micro adjustments as the position I set them to often changes while moving around.

The two biggest Annoyances was the auto pause and turning off the headphones. Auto paused enables itself if you tilt your head down. So while I was looking down on my phone or reading a book this feature would trigger on and off causing me to just turn it off completely.

Second was the stupidest method ever conceived by mankind in turning a Bluetooth headphone off or on. This requires that you always fold the headphone in a very specific manner and pray that it remains folded while being transported without the case. The Problem with this is that most people do not intentionally fold their headphones when taking it off their heads to place on top of their desk. It’s just not intuitive and this was the last issue that caused me to return these.

Maybe next time they will make an awesome set of headphones with out the gimmicks or tricks. I just want something that sounds like the Momentum’s with the comfort and the simplicity of the Bose QC35s.

Sennheiser, look up the word simplicity and functional please.",2
"Noise cancelling is not strong with these headphones.
The sound though. Amazing. Nope, better than that. Songs I've heard my entire life sound like completely new songs.
Everything sounds good. Rock, pop, country, classical. Rap isn't music, so...ask someone else. All frequencies are clear. Not enough bass to vibrate off your noggin but enough to make you smile. Mids and highs are perfect. I tried the EQ in the free app for these and put it back to stock. No adjustments needed.
If you need something for your flight, buy the Sonys or Bose. If you're in an office, coffee shop, or at home, buy these.
Also, the case sucks. It's not hard or very protective. The headphones can turn themselves on there's so much extra space.
Buy a new case if you're taking them anywhere.",5
"Was comparing this to Bose NC 700, and the Momentum 3's clearly sounded better, especially in the sub-bass range. I've heard Sony XM3s, Bose 700, and Momentum 3. This is the best sounding one among the three!

Potential safety hazard: the joint of the folding mechanism is very sharp. While unfolding for the first time, it nipped my hand and it was very painful! Wasn't expecting to shed blood while operating a pair of headphones, but that's actually what happened. Definitely be careful while unfolding these, they ""bite""!",4
"Ordered a pair as soon as it was available, at the beginning, I liked it a-lot! In general this is a great pair of headphones with 2 major flaws.
I will start with good - Sound is good, not amazing but definitely will please most mainstream consumers (not sure the price is mainstream though..) Build quality is amazing, the leather on the ear caps is so soft! features are in line with the time of the release, didn't find anything missing except one major feature - on/off switch, but more about this in cons.
Now to the reasons I returned these.
1. Bluetooth connectivity with Android devices, for some reason, i had constant disconnections and drops when connected to my Galaxy S10+, even after disabling the auto pause function to be sure it is not a sensor sensitivity issue. but it kept disconnecting for a few seconds and then connecting back. I connected my B&O to the same phone and had a very stable connection, reboot everything and connected the Momentum, the problem came back right away. This didn't happen at all when connected to my Ipad, it did not disconnect or skipped a bit.
2. The lack of on/of switch and no Stand By option, as a frequent flier, I move through the airports an in many cases with the headphones around my neck, this is a problem with the Momentum's as it keeps the headphones on and keep draining the battery when you are not actually using the headphones to listen to music or as an ANC set, to switch it off, you have to fold this set and to be honest with this huge and flimsy carrying case it is just basic inconvenience absolutely unnecessary due to exclusion of the on/off switch for the gimmicky fold/unfold mechanism in my opinion.

One last thing to mention, the looks of the headsets on the smaller heads, when the metal holding arms extend below the bottom of the earcups, make it look as a bad fit for the otherwise gorgeously designed piece of tech! but this is very subjective.",3
"Summary: the Momentum 3s sound great and are well built. Fantastic for music, and good enough for calls.

Sound quality: This is the reason to splurge for the Momentum 3s. Great, full-range, tight bass, clear mids and highs. Make sure you've enabled aptX and the maximum bitrate for AAC (search online for instructions on Mac and Android). If you install the Sennheiser app, you can change equalizer settings, like if you want Beats-level bass boost. After playing around, I decided I like the default sound best.

Video: Sounds great. I've experienced no lag with Netflix, YouTube, or Prime Video.

Comfort: Like all over-ear headphones, these can get a little warm. Fine for me. They're also heavier than the all-plastic Bose 700 and Sony XM3, because the Momentum 3s are built with real metal and leather. Weight is similar to the B&W PX7 and B&O H9. I find it ok, and worth it for the sound quality.

Bluetooth: They pair with 2 devices concurrently for audio, and I have them paired with 3 devices in total (MacBook, iPad, and Android phone). Switching works fine.

Controls: They have physical buttons that you learn to find by touch. I find them more reliable and less finicky than touch gestures. (The H9 touch controls didn't work for me at all.) The setting to auto-mute when you remove from your head just didn't work properly for me though. It would mute and unmute if I nodded my head. I turned off the setting, and don't miss it. Not a big deal. The transparency mode is easy to activate with a switch. Some reviewers complain about how you have to fold them to turn them off. I find it no big deal -- it's easy to see that they're folded and off, vs not being sure if the little red light is on.

Build quality: High quality. Solid. Real metal and leather. Downside: they're a little heavier than all-plastic cans like Bose and Sony. I pinched myself with the metal when unfolding them. I can deal.

Case construction: Nice round case, looks high end. It's soft, not hard. It's small enough for my carry on bag and commuter bag. It includes a pocket for a cable in case your battery runs down. Works for me.

Call quality: Sound is great when other people are speaking. At first, I found them pretty awkward for calls, due to the lack of sidetone (hearing your own voice), and would have recommended them only for occasional calls, not if you make lots of video and phone calls. Then I discovered that the app has a setting to give you sidetone! Turn on Transparency mode, and check the box to play music at the same time. Now you can hear the outside world, including your own voice, so you know you're not shouting. Problem solved!

Noise cancellation: Not the main reason why I bought them. This is a bonus feature for me. It helps with public transit and plane noise, and definitely gets the level down enough to make the music or video sound enjoyable. If your #1 goal is noise cancellation, Bose or Sony is probably what you want.

Design: It's subjective. I like the look better than all but the Bang & Olufsen H9s. The white + brown version of the M3s is stylish, though I went with the black.

Conclusion: After extensively researching the options in this price range, and trying multiple headphones, this is the pair I'm keeping. For my personal preferences, these are a winner.",4
"I will compare these to the Bose 700s and Sony XM3s at the end if you’re interested, for now a Momentum 3 review.

DESIGN: These headphones are very sturdy, they feel like a pair of $400 headphones. No squeaking or sliding around. I feel I can safely put these on my backpack without a case and they will be just fine.

APP, BLUETOOTH and EASE OF USE: All you have to do to use the headphones is unfold them and they go into pairing mode, then simply connect to your phone which will ask you to download the Sennheiser app.

Within the app you can change the Noise cancelling between Max, Anti Wind which is just a lower noice cancelling setting, and anti pressure which supposedly reduces the pressure feeling from noice cancelling however I found no difference between max and anti pressure. There is no difference in sound quality either between any of the modes as far as I can tell. You can also turn off noise cancelling altogether and still get the same sound quality.

There is an option called transparent hearing which allows you to hear people’s voices more clearly at the cost of some sound quality, this is useful when walking around the street I suppose.

Lastly there is an Equalizer (EQ) that allows you to adjust the Bass and Trebble which in terms also affects the mids. Its confusing to use and to be honest I prefer the stock setting best.

I haven’t had any issues with the headphones disconnecting, cutting in and out, or not connecting to the app.

NOISE CANCELLING: Noise cancelling is ok, I would say it can block out road noise, and most chatter if you turn the volume up enough. However this will not give you complete silence. Its more of a thing to help you focus on your music.

I ran a small test by putting coffee shop noise on my tv which measured at 85dB. Any louder and you can start to notice the noise. I found it quite surprising that the ANC on these headphones is only a tiny bit better than the one on my Sennheiser 4.50 headphones which are 1/4 the price.

SOUND: This is where these headphones shine. Their sound is crystal clear, the BASS packs a punch which doesn't distort the music or instruments. It doesn't drown out the mids or the vocals. The mids and the highs are also very balanced, it sounds beautiful is the best way I can describe it haha. Some headphones have such bad sound that singing almost becomes a high pitched noise, with the momentums it feels as if someone is singing to you... while musical instruments play along with that voice. With other headphones it just sounds like a bunch of noise clustered together where you cant even tell what instruments are playing and it just sounds like a beat.

MOVIES: The bass from music translates nicely to media. Explosions, car chases, etc all have a punch to them in movies. I can’t think of a better headphone to listen to movies. The momentum 3s enhance your experience as opposed to just letting you listen to what is going on. Also the EQ can be adjusted with as much bass and treble you want and it will save to the headphone itself. So if you connect these via aux to the TV they will keep the EQ.

COMFORT: I left comfort for last because its the biggest downfall at least in my opinion and is the only reason for these headphones getting 4 stars. They are big, bulky, heavy, and you will noice you’re wearing them. These aren’t the headphones you want to walk around with, or take on a flight, or use to study. These headphones are for when you want to enjoy music for 1-2 hours at a time. The metal headband is kind of a pain to adjust, it requires both hands, my hands touching/sliding against the metal bands is kind of concerning as it feels as if Im going to cut myself even though its just a feeling and I doubt its possible. I wish it was covered so It could also have a stealthier look that doesn’t stand out. Simple is better for some. Clamping force is also pretty strong to the point where I have to take them off to rest my ears and my jaw.

Are these worth the $400? Well in my opinion they’re not... why? Because they are uncomfortable. If Im paying $400 for headphones I want to be able to wear them whenever, however long. I want to be able to take them on a walk, to chill in the couch with them, and to use them for movies. It doesn’t matter how good they sound or feel if I can’t wear them for 5+ hours at a time.

Sennheiser Momentum 3 vs Bose 700 vs Sony WF1000XM3

If the sennheiser were more comfortable, and looked like a more normal pair of headphone, i wouldn't even need to write anything here. I would say run out and buy them. However each headphone has their pros and cons.

If you see the term “cabin pressure” it refers to that weird feeling you get when you try ANC Headhones. That underwater feeling.

Bose 700: these have the most neutral sound, they have the least bass out of all three and are also the least loudest. Even with their ANC being almost double the sennheiser I still have to increase the volume to 80% even on a quiet room. They are also the least “fun” to listen too because they sound so flat. However, because of their flat sound signature they sound very accurate and no bass, high, mid is overdone. They are good. In terms of comfort the headphones themselves are comfortable but their ANC gives you that small cabin pressure feeling.

Sony xm3: these have alot of bass but its not the good kind of bass. Its the kind of bass that becomes muffled and distorted. These are by far the least accurate headphones from all 3. Their instrument separation is also bad, there are some instruments you wont even be able to hear with these unless you adjust their eq. However they are more fun to use than the Bose 700s and you will only notice their distortion if you pay close attention. These are also the most comfortable pair of headphones i’ve ever worn. It feels like you’re not even wearing anything. I have worn these for 15 hours at a time. I can fall asleep with them, walk with them, etc. They basically dont exist on my ears. They also have very little to no cabin pressure.

Momentum 3: these sound the best out of the 3. If you take the Sonys “fun” factor and the Boses accuracy you get the mometum 3s. However they’re uncomfortable to wear which is the biggest downfall. The headband has very little padding which becomes bothersome, the ear ups are also super stiff. Their cabin pressure is less than the bose 700s though.

In the end if you’re spending $400 because you want the ultimate headphone for music, movies, and everything sound get the sony xm3. If you want a “stay at home” headphone get the momentum 3s.

If you will only use your headphones for music and you want to use them for long periods of time get the Bose 700s.",5
"When I bought this headphones. Went to compare in Apple Store with Bose 700, and what I can say about this 2 headphones. On Bose better design, battery life, noise cancellation, microphone, but terrible sound quality. On Sennheiser more colorful and strong sound, on Bose sound is very thick and compressed. If for you sound on first place - buy Sennheiser.",5
"Only issues:

Relatively short battery life, as compared to other similar headphones. I haven't really had issues with battery life though -- generally just plug them in after work and they're obviously fully charged the next morning.

Will only charge with included cable... My phone and work computer both charge with usb-c, so I thought it would be convenient to have headphones that also charged with a usb-c cord. Well, these headphones input seem to charge with the included cable. Any wall plug is fine though.

I've had some issues connecting via bluetooth to my work computer (2016 Macbook Pro). Usually this is seamless and doesn't require me to do anything but sometimes I'll have to manually click ""connect"" in the Bluetooth options. Terrible first world problem, I know.

Last dislike: these are pretty expensive, honestly. But you get what you pay for, and I wanted headphones that would last me a long time.

--------

Overall, sound quality is good, noise cancelling is good (don't expect 110% silence though, from these or any other headphones), transparent hearing is actually a really cool feature, and being about to connect to multiple devices fairly seamlessly without an app is really nice.

I picked these over the sony and bose headphones these are often compared against because my priorities were build and sound quality. ANC and battery life were important, but ultimately things that mattered less to me than build/sound quality.

I use these for work and gaming. I work from home, but travel in to the office frequently. These fit my needs really well.",5
"I ordered this set as well as a pair of Beyerdynamic Amion Wireless headphones to compare against each other. After a considerable period of online research and review-reading, I had narrowed my choices down to these two. Honestly, it wasn't even close. The Sennheisers sound far better, fit better, have better BT connectivity and are MUCH cheaper. The Amions, while good, were certainly not good enough to justify the almost $600 price tag. If they were priced at closer to $200, then sure. I will say that I haven't yet had a chance to deal with all of the various and sundry buttons on the Sennheisers, or use them on a phone call (but my main use for these will be at work, so I don't anticipate taking calls while wearing them), so I can't attest to those aspects--and I absolutely refuse to use the noise cancellation, so I am very happy that I can turn it off with a switch, rather than needing a software function through an app, like the Bose QC line. Sound quality is the number one variable for me and using noise cancellation is like trying to listen to music through two bowls of pea soup. Now, as the headline suggests, the sonic quality of these is excellent--especially considering these are BT headphones--but I will say that the overall character of the sound is a wee bit too warm for my taste. It's not mushy--there is good detail and punch--but these were definitely designed to appeal to a more consumer-friendly ear (because consumers have been taught over the past 30 years that tons of bass is more important than overall sound quality). Fortunately, for me, that's not enough of a problem to overcome all of the positives with this product. I plan to use the Sennheiser app just long enough to adjust the EQ on the headset, and then I'm done with it. If Sennheiser wants my data, they can buy it from me, not Hoover it out of my phone for free.",4
"Very happy with my Sennheiser Momentum 3! Next to the Bowers & Wilkins PX7, it's the best sounding headphones I have ever heard! Very close to my PX7 for detail and soundstage! Better audio quality than Sony and Bose! The bass thumps and the highs are so clear! My PX7 and Momentum 3 are my two favorite headphones! I have the Bose 700, Sony WH-1000XM3, Bose QC35II, Bose Soundlink II, and Sony WH-XB900N. Bowers & Wilkins PX7 and Sennheiser Momentum 3 sounds better than all the rest!",5
"I break headphones, usually on the arm just over the cup, despite my best efforts not to (lift off both cups gently at the same time and only as far as I need to remove them). These will not have that problem, while I have concerns about the hinges in the long-term, it's an easier fix with a screwdriver than having to break out the Gorilla Glue.

The battery life averaging 17 hours is a boon as these are not intended for extremely long sessions. The padding on the headband will be giving you a headache by the time you run the battery from full to empty in a session. You can use them as wired headphones as well while charging, which is a feature I've leaned on a few times to save my battery.

The noise cancellation is pretty decent as well, my favorite feature is the Transparent Hearing, you will want to have it set to leave the music playing in the app, this way you can have a conversation with someone without losing all audio from whatever you might be doing, it's also helpful to keep yourself from speaking too loud when using the mic. Speaking of the mic is, it's alright. I'm just told I sound different, but I don't have many audiophile friends that can describe it other than, ""not bad, just different.""

I used the app to drag the EQ a bit up and to the left to get the bit extra bass I like, it's simplified interface is something to get used to, I had a good idea what levels to move where when I find myself working with only a draggable button on a field.

I was considering the Sony XM3s, while some aspects have me thinking the Sony's would be better, the build quality makes up for it, plus genuine leather. Sony may set the hardware standard, but on a flagship product, they couldn't care less if the cups breathe. Gotta keep it all in perspective. Leather.",5
"Pros:

Better call quality. Way better.

Better noise cancelation. It’s not Bose 700 good, but it’s good enough for living next to a busy street in Manhattan.

Neutral

Range isn’t perceptively better than the Momentum 2 for me. If I go my bathroom 15 feet away in my studio apartment it starts cracking. I’m guessing it’s having trouble with the million other 2.4GHz devices nearby.

Cons

It has a USB-C charger but absolutely refuses to charge with any of my USB-C power bricks (Apple and Anker). So much for just taking just my laptop charger with me! Funnily enough, it will work if you use a USB-C to A adapter and back again.

For that reason it charges slowly. The low battery life in class would be fine if it could at least charge quickly.

It has a habit of continuing to play a “leftover tone” at a very low volume after playing some sound. It sounds like a very quiet tinnitus. This with a MacBook Pro.

AAC mode does work with the MacBook Pro, but there’s very high latency. It makes YouTube videos look like poorly lip-synced dubs. This seems to resolve with periodic resetting of Bluetooth from the MBP side.

I don’t know if this is an inherent issue with the codec or a hardware issue, but Sennheiser should just fall back to AptX here. Slightly superior sound quality is not worth how much delay there is. If you’re a competitive gamer, it would be unacceptable.

It seems like a lot of these issues could be resolved. I wouldn’t purchase based on could, though.",3
"I love Sennheiser's sound! I had a pair of HD380 pro headphones from Sennheiser that I loved. My daughter broke them so I used it as an opportunity to switch to a wireless pair. I listened to the Aiwa arc-1, Bose QC 35, Bose 700, Jabra Elite 85, Sennheiser Momentum 2, Sennheiser Momentum 3 and Beats Studio 3 headphones.

They all sound good but the cleanest and most accurate sound AND feeling (yes, your bass should produce a physical sensation) is the Sennheiser Momentum 3.

I originally purchased the Momentum 2 headphones but the ear cups were a little to small for me and it felt like my ear was to close to the speaker.

The Momentum 3 has larger ear cups and more padding. I have had no issues with connectivity and the sound is amazing.

Noise cancellation is ok, which is not the reason I buy headphones at this price.

If you want a great sound that you can tweak even more with their app, I'd recommend the Sennheiser Momentum 3.",5
"I had the previous gen momentums, and was initially pleased with this upgrade. Over time, I found them to be almost useless because they would constantly pause my media. Attempts to turn this off with their broken mobile app failed for weeks, until I was finally able to get them to connect last night. Once I upgraded the firmware to 3.x and turned off the auto-pause feature, these headphones became usable. If you love the sound but hate the functionality, try and get an upgrade installed before sending them back.

I'm leaving this review at 3 stars due to the headache I had to go through to make these not work like cheap garbage.",3
"For listeners who care more about sound quality than isolation, these headphones are a must. I upgraded to these from the Sennheiser HD 380 Pro, and I am very happy with them. The attention to detail in the construction and tuning stand out, while the isolation is more focused on enhancing audio quality than it is supreme isolation from all outside noise. The first test drive with these was on a four hour flight. I wore them straight through and had no ear fatigue or discomfort from excess pressure. The ear cups and head band are very soft and comfortable! The talk-through feature allowed me to hold full conversations with my wife and airline stewards without missing anything. Would recommend for someone who is on the go and cares more about a flat response and punchy bass than someone who wants a higher end noise canceling headphone.",5
"After using these cans, it is hard to go back to any other headphones. The sony xm3's and the bose 700 offer better noise canceling when compared to the Sennheiser's. But no one is going to need such a high level of noise-canceling in regular use unless they are frequent flyers. The sound quality is where the Sennheiser's shine. They have heavy bass without compromising the mids and highs. It makes any kind of music fun and enjoyable. You will never be disappointed with this purchase. People who value sound quality and comfort should definitely have this as their number 1 priority.
The comfort is super amazing. so soft and the real lambskin leather enables me to wear it for prolonged time periods.
They are Sennheiser, you can't go wrong.",5
"Bought these to upgrade from my Sennheiser Momentum 2 headphones that I purchased a few years ago.

YES these are worth the extra $$$ to upgrade.
Observations
Sound quality is significantly improved over the Momentum 2's. Hard to describe but it is richer, the background sounds in the recording come out and FLAC audio plays beautifully on them.
The smart application is a little buggy but not worth taking a point off. having to delete and re-add is a little annoying.
Firmware update process for the headphones was painless however.
Transparent hearing is a nice new feature. Keeps ANC (active noise cancellation) active but mid range sounds (voice) transmits through. Also a plus when singing as your own voice comes through loud and clear.
The EQ is interesting. Jury is still out on full benefits but you can definitely hear differences as you adjust realtime.

Verdict? Indulge your ears and buy them.",5
"Even though I love music and have several pair of headphones, I probably fall short of being called an audiophile as I don’t know most of the technical terms related to headphones. So here’s my decidedly layman’s review:

Received these today. Been listening to these off-and-on since. Even compared them to three of my other headphones (Beats Studio Wireless, Beats Studio Wired, and B&O H4 Wireless). This certainly outperforms all three (plus my Wireless Parrots) in almost and maybe every way. So far, I can confidently say these are the best headphones I’ve ever owned.

Sound - best sounding headphones I’ve ever owned with the most accuracy of sound. I used to really like headphones that emphasized the bass (thus the previous Bests headphones), but now I lean toward more accuracy of sound. The bass is still there, but it’s not overpowering.

ANC - these are the first headphones I’ve owned where I think I actually prefer to listen in Noise Cancelling mode. Usually I find ANC to flatten the sound, but here I find it actually results in slightly more depth and breadth of the sound field. So far, I seem to gravitate to the Anti-Wind setting which equates to the medium ANC setting.

Battery Life - they arrived out of the box with 20% battery life. After playing with them a bit, I decided I better get them to a full charge. Probably because I kept checking on them, it seemed like they might not ever get past 60%, but after leaving them alone longer they reached 100%. They dipped down to 80% earlier but another charge and they were pretty quickly back to 100%. So far, much better than my Parrots which had the worst battery life of any wireless headphones I’ve ever owned. I also like that by pressing the middle button on the right cup, it verbally tells you the remaining battery life. In addition, you can see the battery life on the app on your phone as well as on the battery section on your iPhone itself.

Been listening you them over an hour since last full charge and they’re still at 100%.

Controls - I find them pretty intuitive. Phone paired pretty easily with my iPhone. It took a little more persistence to pair it with the Bluetooth adapter attached to my old school home stereo system, but that probably has more to do with my adapter and my own learning curve (adapter is new too).

The top button is for turning ANC on or off as well turning Transparent Hearing on or off. So far, I like ANC on and Transparent Hearing turned off. That may change once I can travel (fly) for work again.

Apps - the primary app is pretty cool. There are three ANC settings - Max, Anti Wind (medium), and Anti Pressure (low). So far, I find I like the aural soundscape of Anti Wind the best.

It also tells you if you have Transparent Hearing turned on or off. You can also turn TH on/off via the app.

There also is an equalizer but as opposed to my B&Os, so far I find I find I like it better if I leave it alone.

As noted above it also tells you your remaining battery life.

There is also a separate Tile app available you can use to locate your headphones. Through the app, you can see how close you are to your headphones as well “find” them by causing them to vibrate and emit a signal. Useful for sure, but I wish they emitted a louder sound. Not sure I’d hear them if there was any other sound around like in a loud airport.

A little about how I’ve used them today and what I’ve listened to:

Listened to a lot of Madonna today. Ray of Light album was first thing I tried out via my iPhone (Apple Music) as it has a pretty ambient soundscape. I wasn’t quite as blown away as I had hoped, but headphones did a very good job. This might be one where tampering with equalizer might be useful.

I also listened to soundtrack for movie W.E. Wow. Sounded just phenomenal.

Also listened to Sinead O’Connor’s Lion and the Cobra on vinyl via Bluetooth adapter connected to old school sound system. Overall, it did a good job given I was listening via pieced together technology. I’ll probably go back to just listening to vinyl on speakers, but still need to try it out with CD player. After, I did listen to Sinead’s I Want Your (Hands on Me) on my iPhone (Apple Music) and it sounded great although I did detect a bit of white noise hiss, but I attribute that more to it being an analog recording that likely hasn’t been digitally remastered.

Also, some Ben Platt (also Apple Music on iPhone). Sounds great.

Now listening to Madonna Madame X (Apple Music on iPhone). Sounds pretty phenomenal and I’m finding it a bit of fun to tamper with the equalizer on this one.

Also, since I have an iPhone, I didn’t bother messing with setting up Alexa as my assistant. I’ll stick with Siri.

For three years, I’ve known my next headphones would probably either be Sennheiser or Master & Dynamic. After doing a lot of research again recently before purchasing these, I think I made the right choice.

Update: Day 2

Woke up late this morning and grabbed my headphones which have been charging overnight. Soon as I put them on, they automatically paired with my iPhone and started playing Lucky Star which I had started before I went to bed last night.

I listened to rest of Madonna’s debut album
as well. Her debut isn’t the most aurally nuanced (which is one of its charms). I’ve also listened to this album a ton since it came out in 1983 so wasn’t expecting any major surprises. However, I noticed certain elements that haven’t been as prominent to me before like certain percussion elements (Borderline) or saxophone riffs (I Know It) or synthesizer flourishes (Holiday/Think of Me).

I do notice the headphones being a little more “touchy” as far as turning off/pausing if I touch them or turn so one of the cups touches a pillow. Not too annoying though. Just tried to recreate making it pause with those same motions and it didn’t do it now.

Also sometimes when I put them around my neck or put them down, they automatically quit playing but often I have to put them in folded up position to turn them off although using middle button on right cup also seems to work. I don’t find (as some users have) that the phones are super sensitive to how they’re folded to be turned off so I like that. As long as they’re folded, they turn off.

Wireless reach - I forgot to mention that when I listened to vinyl last night, the stereo is on second floor and I was in living room and I had no loss of signal so that was good.

Loudness - phones do get plenty loud (certainly loud enough). Do I wish they got a bit louder? Sure, but they get quite loud for wireless headphones and it’s probably a good thing for my hearing they don’t get louder.

Another Update:

I don’t really use headphones for phone calls so can’t comment on that.

Case - I actually like it. Much better than no case (I had to order a third party for my B&O headphones) or just a cloth bag. I know some would prefer a harder outer shell to the case and are worried their headphones will get damaged in their bag through the case, but it’s not like I’m gonna be packing ginsu knives in my totes or duffels. The cloth case will actually help it take up less room in my bag. I also like the inner pouch to hold the charging cable and cord for wired listening.

I agree the equalizer could be a little more well designed (I actually like the equalizer on the B&O app), but I’m having more fun playing with it.",5
"I ve used these headphones for several months now and they work very well. They pair quickly with my phone 95% of the time. The sound quality is very nice. I have the bose earbuds too and obviously these headphones provide better sound quality.
I like how it turns off automatically when you put the headphones around your neck. I like the soft leather ear muffs and the metal construction. You can get a little pinch if your finger is in the hinge when you open up the speakers but you only make that mistake once.",5
"While perhaps not the most precise reproduction of every frequency, the soundstage created by these is amazing. coupled with the noise cancellation, I find I can close my eyes and just experience the music.

I have periodic Bluetooth connection issues, but it may be my iPhone with too many Bluetooth items. A toggling of Bluetooth on my phone fixes it.

Lastly, the auto-pause is pretty good. It’s not perfect, but if you wait the 5s to let it calibrate it’s great. If it’s a problem, you can use the app to turn it off.

Overall I recommend them without reservation over the Sony competition or any headphones in this price range.",5
Not a audiophile guy but it does sound like Sony's WHXM3 which provides similar sound quality but better ANC. The lows are really heavy and ruin the mids and highs.,3
"Accidentally clipped my finger when I was unfolding the headphone.
Bluetooth priority is confusing.
About the smart pause, it happened once that my iPhone started playing music instead of playing from the headphone for about 2 seconds. Not sure whether this related to iOS 13 or not.",3
"I upgraded from the previous version (2.0), that I owned for 4+ years, and I can still use them - the 2.0 I own can't charge anymore, because of the port that broken of too many uses (they were used almost every single day, for at least 8h). I upgraded to these, and I can tell that while in terms of ANC if wasn't upgraded that much, the sound does live up to expectations. The sound quality is really good, and you can listen to pretty much anything as if it was played in front of you (kinda exaggerating, of course there's better headphones, but good for the price). The ANC is not as good as it could have been - but the sound quality definitely makes it for me, as it's good enough with sounds (and the ANC) that it actually hides pretty anything else.
On the battery side, it lasts for about 16h from my use which is more that enough (volume dependent), especially if you travel a lot. The USB-C/A port makes it very easy to charge everywhere, and if you're without charge within 10 minutes it gets you to about an hour of charge, which is incredible if it's a long trip.
Microphone - perfect for casual use, people might notice you're talking through the headset but the sound is very clear
All in all, a very solid headset!
Something I learned: if you feel annoyed by the sound stopping when you do a specific movement, - feat not! Just disable the ""Smart Pause"" feature in the mobile app, and when re-enabling it, it'll allow you to calibrate it to yourself so it actually becomes smart, and it does work every well.
If you have the 2.0 and it still works as expected, I don't think it's an upgrade (in terms of price - if you can afford it, go for it). In all other cases, go for it! There's also other nice-to-have features, which just makes the overall experience amazing.",5
"I really do like these headphones, but they don't like me. Kept on automatically pausing my music and disconnecting from my phone. Maybe because I wore glasses, idk. But our relationship came to an end due to inconsistency. -also they need to have the option to turn off Bluetooth so you can plug into the phone via audio cable and know that your saving power.",2
"Everyone know how good these sound...but one major flaw is the bluetooth. Not blaming Sennheiser, since this is a general issue with bluetooth, but buyers should know. Even with bluetooth 5.0. A- it often drop even at arm's length. B-. Lag, simply not suitable for gaming. Especially, online shooters like PUBG. The smart pause--though nice most of the time- can be accidentaly truggered and can be annoying when you are just moving around. ( reviewed with firmware 3.1.3)",4
"I use these at the gym. Every time a dumbbell approaches my head the Bluetooth disconnects. I ordered a replacement pair, updated the software, still the same problem. Even on the treadmill they go on and off. I own the previous model which has none of these problems. Yes, the sound is improved but functionality is gone. Also why the indicator light for noise cancellation is in the back? If in front, I could check in a mirror. Because sometimes after the Bluetooth disconnects ANC also turns off.
Update: after turning “smart pause “ now they are usable and merit 4 stars.",1
"5/5 Sound quality when wireless. When I plugged in for wired sound expecting to be blown away, the output was only occurring in one ear. No matter... I plan on using these wirless 95% of the time

3/5 Noise Cancellation. Being generous with this grade. I love how their are three settings (4 if you include transparent hearing), but the settings differ from ""is noise cancellation on? (Low)"" to ""ah! I think it is on. (Medium/""Wind setting?"")"" to ""I guess it is on.. but ill just turn the volume up. (Max)""

1/5 Accessories: Well they included the charger... but not the usb-c block. When using other companies blocks, such as apple, I have heard but not experienced that there have been issues. The headphone cord simply does not work. The carrying case will carry your headphones but by no means protect.

Design is great and why I am not giving this 2 stars. But a lot of issues with this product. Only reason why I have not returned them yet is because I ordered a different pair of headphones and waiting for them to be delivered.",3
"I purchased an open box pair of headphones which were in pristine condition for $250 US dollars. Unlike most YouTube reviews of these headphones I found the carrying case to be great, and water proof/resistant judging by its zipper. Great sounding cans, modern Tech with Bluetooth 5.0 and a super solid construction. Metal headband with sheepskin leader.",5
"Amazing sound, great for pop and metal

Updates:
My subjective opinions: After one week of serious listening on these, the bass sounds too much. The headband adjuster is loose and I need to adjust them constantly. The earcup is just a little bit too small for me (I have big head and ears) but it shouldn't be a problem for most of the people.

Overall, this headphone is probably the best choice for noise cancelling headphone. Before purchase, you should consider if you really need noise cancelling - if not, there are many, many better choices.",4
These are the 2nd pair of Sennheiser’s that I have owned. I owned the M2’s before buying the M3’s. I’m going to get this out of the way 1st. The M3’s are the best headphones on the market currently at any price point in terms of sound quality. These headphones are more for delivering high quality sound vs say Bose noise cancelling headphones that are more catered to noise cancellation. I rather listen to rich music with optimum isolation from background noise vs perfect isolation and mediocre sound. Buy them if you are serious about listening to music the way it was made in the studio.,5
"When I turn my head to the side headphones think I’m taking them off, pausing audio. That’s mildly annoying.
When multiple devices are connected, headphones have a mind of their own on what should be played and where. I’ve messed with this a lot and it is very squirrelly. You can pause your music turn on a YouTube video, and it will mute the youtube video and resume your music on the other device (not through headphones). OR you have to figure out which app is the preferred app at the time on which device, otherwise your music/video will auto pause over and over until you disconnect all your devices and only have one source of audio on one device. You cannot play music in the background while on a call. I cannot stress enough how annoying this is 6 MONTHS into owning the headphones.
The sound quality, is excellent. They are comfortable for a long time, and the battery life/noise canceling are fine. If they can fix the ""smart"" software these headphones will be excellent. As it stands I wouldn't recommend these to anyone.",3
"Incredible fn sound...if you’re laying stationary, on your back. Don’t move an inch though, or they’ll the Bluetooth connection. To anything, really. iPhone, iPad, MacBook... it’s a damn shame that headphones of the quality (the sound is A+) could have hangups like this",3
"I love the build quality and sound. I own the HD650, so it's safe to say I expect a lot from Sennheiser headphones. The noise cancelation is passable but less than impressive. The battery life is more than enough for me but significantly less than others at this price point. The real issues are connectivity. I often lose connection outdoors sporadically. It's almost as if someone is pulling on the non-existent cable. Furthermore I am unable to connect to the tile app. That said I would award 5 stars if these last two issues were resolved.",3
"Love these headphones. I bought (and returned) 4 different bluetooth headphones before keeping these (including the Focal Listens which I hated). The sound is very clear and full. I didn't want the Bose because it makes every song sound like ""Bose"". The app/EQ lets you tune the music to your taste, I like heavy bass on some songs, but not on EVERY song.

The only con I can think of is, the Soundstage is small... BUT you can put bigger pads on these to open it up a bit, Brainwavz Ovals do a very nice job.",5
"Great sounding, comfortable, and 4/5 on noise cancellation. Folding on/off is very convenient. USB-C for fast charging. Well worth the cost imo.",5
These headphones are the best when i get more money iam buying a secound pair these headphones sound incredible the only one thing i didnt like is they should of came with a hard shell case,5
"I PAID FOR A 3 YEAR WARRANTY THROUGH AMAZON PRIME (ASIN BO7PC35J78) WITH ASURION. WHEN THIS PRODUCT GOT DAMAGED I CONTACTED ASURION APPROXIMATELY 3 WEEKS AGO, THEN ON JUNE 2 AND AGAIN TODAY.

HOPEFULLY AS A LONG TIME MEMBER OF AMAZON PRIME, AMAZON WILL BE ABLE TO ASSIST ME SO THAT THE DAMAGED PRODUCT CAN BE REPLACED AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. THANKS.",5
Defective product wont send a replacement poor seller,1
I love this product strictly for the music quality. If you want noise cancellation call quality go with the bows for call quality and the Sony XM three for noise cancellation. However if you want strictly music go with these you will not be disappointed,5
"I got the momentum 3's strictly for sound ANC isn't a concern. Wow these deliver on sound, bass very impressive, mids for vocals and highs are spot on",5
"As stated in the title, the sound quality was great as to be expected from Sennheiser. The improved controls in comparison to the last model were the main selling point for me. Battery life is a bit worse then the momentum 2.0 but it is livable.",4
Amazing quality that you would associate with Sennheiser. Returned it though because I have a rather small head and it had the tendency to shift around/fall off if I were to move my head around or look down.,4
Amazing sound ! So crisp and clear with great base. These look retro but have all the modern features. I live they turn on when opened and pause / play when removed or put back on. Way better than Bose hands down.,5
"thanks you
Good product",5
I love the way these headphones sound. The bluetooth connection is erratic. Sometimes perfect other times dropping every 10 minutes or pausing. If they didn't sound great I would return these. I have to call Sennheiser to see if they can trouble shoot,3
Best sounding phones on the market with more than adaquate mood cancelling,5
"I've had my pair for about 8 months and have had numerous issues, such as Bluetooth disconnections, static, and today the right side stopped working. I'm very disappointed and this will probably be my last pair from Sennheiser.",2
"The sound quality of Sennheiser Momentum 3 is very good, the bass is strong, the mid-tone tone is also very pleasant, the treble is not harsh.
The manufacturing quality is very good.
It's great for listening to music and movies.",5
"Great sound and easy setup.
Noise cancellation works pretty well. Unfortunately the different modes are locked behind the Sennheiser app as far as I know, and the app is terrible.",5
Hubby loves them but not all smart devices are compatible,5
"It was great except that it made my ears too warm. That doesn't bother a lot of folks, but I'm peculiar this way.",3
If you wear glasses you might want to pass on these.,1
Quite bulky. If you have a small head then they might look a bit silly. But the sound quality is incredible and well worth the purchase.,4
Got someones returned dirty used pair of headphones i dont know how amazon considers this new gross,1
"Gift for my husband, he absolutely loves them",5
I use these at work. Helps drown out noise in the office & lab. Auto-connect and auto-resume features are great! I love the materials.,5
So much better than my sony headphones which broke four times in the same place even after i replaced parts and treated them delicately,5
Some of the best sound quality you'll ever experience in an extremely well built package.,5
"Sounds amazing, n/c is good, very comfortable. A bit bulky but good fit!",5
"According to most professional reviews I've read (more than a dozen), these aren't the best in noise canceling, though a couple reviewers don't notice a difference with the best Sony or Bose, and they're improved over the Momentum 2.

BUT some prefer the sound of the Sennheisers enough to more than make up for potential differences in noise cancelation. I haven't heard the others, but I do love the sound of these and find the noise suppression good enough.

The sound (also reportedly improved over the 2) is clear and clean, detailed, with powerful, extended bass. The top end is handled in a way that makes them easy to listen to at any volume, even with material that isn't well recorded. That's a useful feature in phones sometimes used for resting. And the frequency balance can be (roughly) adjusted with the app.

Along with my other comments I'm going to include a few not-very-technical explanations of technical points for those who may want them.

These are Bluetooth 5 compliant (backward compatible) and can use aptX, aptX Low Latency, AAC, and SBC codecs for high quality sound and lack of delay.

Noise canceling

According to an engineer who has worked on it (quoted at soundstagesolo), standard active noise-canceling (ANC) works for low and low-midrange frequencies, below 1kHz. Noise isolation for upper-mids and highs, he says, is passive, i.e. good sound insulation.

That may be why these phones cancel low-frequency noise impressively well, but higher frequencies somewhat less.

In the default max cancellation mode, the sound from my TV's good external speakers is reduced from loud and full to something like a cell phone speaker several feet away, still quite audible if I don't have anything playing on the headphones. Similarly, standing next to a highway, traffic noise is nearly eliminated in the lows but still clearly audible, if much quieter, higher up.

There's an anti-pressure ANC mode (accessed via the app) that's supposed to prevent the feeling of pressure in the ears some people experience with ANC (more below). It sounds similar to the max mode but with a little more mid-frequency sound coming through.

And there's an anti-wind mode. It cuts lower-pitched wind noise better than the max mode, though some higher-pitched whistling sounds get through with both. For other kinds of noise it's less effective.

(No) pressure

According to the sound engineer, an abrupt transition between active and passive cancelation around 1kHz causes some people to feel a pressure sensation in their ears, which can be mild to painful. Many others don't feel it. (Theory and measurements suggest there isn't any change in pressure; it may be sound traits the brain interprets as pressure.)

So there may be a tradeoff between cancelation and feeling pressure. The headphones with the maximum canceling right up to near 1kHz may cause the most pressure sensation. Those that taper off the ANC more gradually, and consequently let more sound in leading up to 1kHz, seem to cause less trouble.

That may be why the anti-pressure mode on these lets more midrange sound in.

But even the max mode seems not to bother people. I haven't seen any reports of people feeling pressure in the ears with the ANC on these headphones.

Hear the Beard (sound quality)

That's Dusty Hill's Beard. These are a bassist's dream, with strong extended bass, well into subwoofer range. (No loss of power at 20Hz, usually considered the lower limit of hearing. Sennheiser claims a remarkable 6Hz-22kHz range.) And it's clean and tight. I always evaluate headphones with a set of songs I know well, including ZZ Top's ""I Thank You,"" which has a prominent bass line from Mr. Hill. On these phones it throbs and pulses like with no others I've tried, but it's still in control, doesn't muddy up the song.

The extended bass is especially satisfying with pipe organ music, where the pedal work is often only hinted at with other headphones. These rumble and growl as they should.

It handles even the deepest rap beats with ease.

Some people (not me) find the bass too much. They might want to use the EQ function (see below).

The rest of the frequency spectrum is also clean, detailed, with good separation and soundstage. The top is lively but not hot. Sibilants aren't harsh, hi-hats sound natural. Like most headphones, they roll off some of the very highest sounds between 10-20kHz, some of which most of us can't hear anyway. That's generally for the best. These are more relaxed and less fatiguing than phones that don't roll off the very top.

There's no distortion at extreme volume. They can get louder than I can listen to with most inputs, and no source I've tried has been too quiet to get the volume I want.

EQ

There's an equalizer function in the app. It doesn't allow fine control over any portion of the frequency range, but you can move a dot that adjusts the frequency-response curve to boost or lessen either or both ends or the middle. It's flexible and effective in a broad way, and easy enough. Once you adjust it, it stays that way until you change it.

ANC sound quality

ANC presents challenges for sound quality that some phones don't overcome well. With these the effect is small, usually unnoticeable even in a quiet environment. If I'm paying close attention, these sometimes sound a little more open and airy with ANC off.

Isolation

The closed design with thick ear pads that seal well means better isolation from others hearing what you're listening to, though they can still hear a little if they're close in.

Transparent mode

There's a button on the headphones for this. It's not quite like taking the phones off, but it's close enough to clearly hear others talking, TV, or whatever. Via the app you can set it so music stops in transparent mode, which is the default, or keeps going.

Bluetooth

Bluetooth connectivity is fine with my 2016 MacBook Pro, not so great with my 2011 MBP, where there's breakup and pausing after a while. With the latter, which I only use for sports video streaming (17""), I use the cable instead with no trouble.

You can connect to two devices at once.

Wired

These come with a cable to use with a regular 1/8"" (3.5mm) headphone jack. For some music it sounds even better, a little cleaner and more open still. Mostly the sound is very similar as long as the power is on.

With the headphones powered off (open while pushing the middle button), the sound isn't as good in my experience, but they're still usable that way in a pinch.

Bluetooth is automatically disabled when plugged in, so you can't take or make calls. You can't use the music controls either. But you can still use ANC as long as the battery has power. If no battery power, you can still listen without ANC.

Getting the plug in right on the ear cup was more difficult than it should be at first, but not hard now. You have to line up a tiny notch on the plug with a tiny protrusion on the jack and then push in and twist clockwise. The good part is that it stays in very securely.

For some setups you can also get audio via the USB cable, though my Mac doesn't recognize it for that.

Fit, physical comfort

On my average-size male head the ear cups pressed tightly at first, but after some use and some very gentle headband stretching they became very comfortable. You can speed that up by keeping the ear cups spread across something the size of or a little larger than your head overnight. You need them to remain snug, though, so that they'll seal well.

The ear pads are luxurious, supple leather over soft padding. They're very deep, so even though my ears stick out they don't get mashed down as they do with most headphones.

The ear pads get a good seal with glasses. I've worn these for hours at a time without any discomfort from glasses.

The headband has the same supple leather but with less padding, about 1/4"". The padding is a little over an inch wide at the top, divided into two ridges that run the length of the headband, probably cooler that way. As with most headphones, after a while I get a pain at the crown of my head and need to move the headband for a second, and then it's comfortable again.

At just under 11 ounces these are 0.9 ounces heavier than Sony's WH-1000MX3 and 1.6 ounces more than Bose's 700.

Buttons

I'm not wild about touchpad controls on headphones, which tend to do things I don't want, so I'm glad these have buttons. They're easy to use, though it takes a little homework to learn all the ways to use them.

There's one for ANC on/off and transparent mode.

There are two for volume up and down and mic muting.

Between the volume buttons is a ""multifunction"" button that controls music playback, phone functions, battery check, and opening without turning on.

And there's a voice assistant button that also handles pairing and flight mode (Bluetooth off).

There's no on/off button. They turn on when you open them, and go off when you close them. You can open them without turning them on by holding down the multi-function button while opening.

Call quality

I don't use these for calls, but I've noticed the professional reviews generally think they're good, with clear sound on both ends. A couple have found it sounds clear but a little distant to those on the other end.

Battery life

At 13-17 hours per charge with Bluetooth and ANC on (according to various tests), these don't offer as much as the nearest competitors, or the Momentum 2.

You can quick-charge these for 10 minutes to get another 1-1/2 hours of use. It's 3 hours for a full charge.

Unlike many competitors, you can still use these while they're charging.

You can also use them without the battery like normal wired headphones, though you lose the ANC if the battery's dead.

The battery isn't user replaceable, which is sadly the usual these days. Sennheiser says they'll replace it for a fee.

A USB-C charging cable is included, with a USB-A adapter.

Other points

There's a Smart Pause feature that pauses music when you take the phones (or right ear cup) off. It can also take a call when you put the phones on, mute it when you take them off, and resume when you put them back on. Some people have found it may pause/mute if they turn their heads a certain way or even yawn. I turned it off in the app, as I usually don't want pausing.

As mentioned above, you can open these without powering them on, by pushing the middle button while opening.

TILE compliant, if you want to set up that app so you can find these when you lose them.

NFC compliant.

The app has been stable on my Android phone, but it doesn't always show the battery level.

The case is nice but bulkier than it needs to be. I think I'll use a pouch instead.

There are voice and tone prompts. You can turn either or both off with the app.

There's a fairly detailed online manual.

Warranty is two years, doesn't cover batteries or ear cushions (also replaceable).

"This pair of headphones is not going to be for everyone, but as I've learned while trying to find the ""perfect"" ANC headphones, no pair of headphones will be. For me, the Momentum 3 is the best option out there and I will explain why below:

Sound:
I'll be honest, while I do care about ANC, sound is by far the most important aspect to headphones for me. Yes, I want to block out noise, but I mostly use these in an office setting where even mediocre ANC and decent sound level will allow me to block out the world quite nicely. That being said, this set of headphones has by far the best sound of any set of ANC headphones I've tried. I have compared these against the HD1 wireless over ear headphones, B&O H9 3rd generation, Plantronics Backbeat Pro, Master and Dynamic MD60 wireless, B&W PX and PX7, Sony 1000MX3 and Bose 700.

First, let me explain the sound of the Momentum 3's. I would call it exciting. It has just enough high end to include every detail of the music and a good deal of low so you also feel it. The bass is boosted a bit but not overdone and does not drown out or distort vocals/highs/mids. You can also adjust the EQ settings but in most cases I don't believe the they need any adjusting. The clarity of these headphones is one of the key points I love. When listening to a track like Chris Stapelton's Death Row, you can hear every detail like the picking of his guitar, the reverb from the bass, the breath between vocals, and other details that you won't hear even on other $4-500 headphones. Listening to the Brett James version of ""stay with me"" on youtube with a full orchestra you can identify every instrument playing with clarity and it sounds amazing. You feel like you are immersed in the music and the detail which is why I call the sound exciting. While the highs are on full display with these headphones, they are not to the point of being shrilly like even the H9 3rd gens can do.

Other than sound, the headphones have improved ear pads over the HD1's and are more comfortable. I didn't know if I would like that they are a little bigger than the HD1's but it improves comfort. I think they look much better than the HD1's but if you are a minimalist, you may like the M2 version better. There is no physical power button which is very annoying. The case does not hold them shut securely and if they aren't held shut they turn on. So, I took the case from my HD1's which holds them shut and use the M3 case for my HD1's. That solved the problem of them turning on when in transit and not being used. I would really like a physical power button which they could solve with a software update. The padding on top is 1000 times better than the lack of padding on the HD1. Finally, I like the physical buttons but I preffered the slider type button for volume on the HD1 and the volume buttons are not differentiated enough so by tough it;s hard to tell if I'm on the top, middle or lower button. These are annoying things but not annoying enough for me to pass up that sound....

Okay, here's my comparison to other headphones. Disclaimer - we all have different tastes in sound and I think our ears can be tuned to certain sounds after time, so while this is based on my experience, if you have a different sound preference or your ears are tuned to more of a B&W house sound or a flat sound like the Audio-Technica M50's, you may think I'm way off. So, this is based on my ears and listening preference, which is as much clarity as possible with enough bass to make me feel the music. The Momentum 3's (M3's) are perfect for me this this regard.

Beoplay H9 3rd Generation - I really wanted to like these better but the sound is much warmer and with nowhere near the clarity as the M3's. Battery life on these is a great 30 hours but the touch controls are very wonky. I often couldn't get them to work right and didn't use them. I do really like how deep the bass gets on these, in fact if you are a fan of sub-bass, these are your cans, but that alone is not enough for me. These completely lose the clarity and detail the M3's show. If you prefer a warmer sound with deeper bass, you might like these better. ANC on both of these are sub-par against Bose or Sony 1000MX3 but the sound is leaps and bounds better. I prefer sound over ANC so I'd pick these or M3 over Bose or Sony. These headphones look amazing, are built well and are very comfortable but every now and then my right ear rubs which is annoying

Bowers and Wilkins PX and PX7 - I know people swear by this brand, but I have never been a fan of their sound. I owned the PX wireless and wanted to love them, but they sounded tinny and the clamping force gave me headaches. I listened to a set of the new PX7's but again, the sound was very warm and dull, not how I hear them often described. I'm not sure if I've had 2 defective pair, but what I have tried rises nowhere near the level of a $400 set of headphones.

Momentum 2/HD1 Wireless: These were my favorite set of headphones until I got the H9 3rd generations. Between the H9 and these, they both have certain things they are very good at. These have that clarity and detail I love but the bass can lack. As noted above, the H9 lacks the detail and clarity but has that sub-bass, so I carried both these sets depending on what I was listening to and what type of experience I wanted. IMO, the M3 negates the need to carry 2 sets as it covers what the M2's had and has great bass, even if not quite as deep as the H9's. M2/HD1's did not have ANC that could be turned off and the top padding was horrible, but overall they were great headphones, folded up compact for travel, and had good sound and fine call quality for office use. Not as great as the M3's though.....

Master and Dynamic - I didn't spend too much time with these, but it took only a few minutes to realize these had a lot of detail on the high range and very flat bass. These are tuned more towards the higher range or a flat EQ setup. These just ooze quality, and they feel good on the head, possible better than the M3's, but I was not a fan of the flat EQ. I didn't test ANC on these.

Plantronics Backbeat Pro - while these are great headphones for the $1-200 range and do serve a purpose, they significantly lack the clarity the M3's have. I didn't expect them to, and to be honest I'm not sure why I even included these, but if a person is looking for a cheaper set of ANC headphones with a lot of good features, these are a good set and worth mentioning.

Bose 700/Sony 100MX3 - I put these in the same bucket because if you are looking specifically for ANC, you are going to disregard most of what I've written and go straight to one of these. The ANC on either of these is the best of the bunch, but the sound lacks against the M3. Sony IMO has better sound that Bose and possibly better ANC, but still does not hold a candle to M3's. I would call the sound on these mediocre compared to the M3. Battery on these is much better as well, so again, if you are a frequent traveler and want to fly around the world 3 times without recharging while hearing absolutely none of the outside world, then you are looking here and not the M3.

Final verdict:
As I stated at the beginning, I use these mostly in an office and not for traveling, so I'm much more concerned with sound that ANC or battery life. These have by far the best sound out there, killing even the M2/HD1's. ANC is mediocre but works fine for an office environment, I would really love a software update to allow one of the physical buttons to be used as an on/off switch, and the case that comes with it stinks (the HD1 case is way better so I switched them), but I still think they are fantastic headphones with killer sound. In fact the best sound by far of any of the premium wireless headphones I've tried and that is what I focus on for my headphones.",5
"These sennheiser momentum Bluetooth wireless headphones are awesome!
I’ll try to be as comprehensive as I can in this review, without boring you with “audiophile “ bs.
First, they are made very well with leather ear cups and headband; this is typical Sennheiser quality. The features are amazing. When listening to music, you can pause them just by lifting them off your head, and then when you put them back on, they automatically resume playing. To turn off, you simply fold them together, and a little voice says”power off”. Pairing with my iPhone was ridiculously simple; I took them out of the box, unfolded them, and they instantly paired with my phone. I’ve never seen anything like that before. They have controls on the ear cup as well as the free app for your phone which instantly found the senns.
Now for the sound. Just fantastic! The best I’ve heard, and I’ve had a lot of headphones in my 75 years. Deep bass, and wonderful highs, just very musical. The noise canceling is better than my Bose quiet comforts.
Although the Bose are lighter, I prefer the Sennheiser.
The one thing I don’t care for is the carrying case; it looks like a cake box. Comon, Sennheiser, you can do better than that! There is no protection for the headphones in this, it’s very soft. Otherwise, these are well made, quality, great sounding phones that are beautiful as well. I highly recommend!
Ps just an update; these are not light weight, so I don’t know if ear fatigue will sent in during a long listening session. I will update",5
"Do not buy, no way to repair after warranty and batteries die.",1
"Picked these up at BB - sorry its not verified, but i swear they are sitting on my desk right now.

Its been along ANC BT journey for me -

I started with the Sony's - every reviewer out there said it was the best for the money, best sound, best features blah blah blah. I didnt find them particularly comfortable - the soundstage was just absent, it sounded like the music was coming from inside your head (thats a bad thing) - NC was the best, i will agree, but it added some weird pressure in my ears i just didnt care for - returned them as i just expected more from all these glowing reviews.

Bought the bose 700 - uncomfortable from the start - headband to thin, silicone supported by air. It hit the crown of my head kind of hard. NC was good, not as good as sony - call quality was better than sony though. sound was also better - more impactful, much better soundstage, no sibilance detected - but the comfort killed me - returned them

Went to BB to check out the px7 - right next to them was the momentum3. They werent even on my radar, because i had the first pair of wired momentums years back, and they were too small for my huge ears. I figure though, since im there, might as well compare the two. Immediately i noticed that the sennheiser was quicker, explosive almost. It was a little bass heavy, but its customizable in the app - px7 was also bass heavy, but it felt more bloated and its not customizable. Music seperation was better, soundstage larger, mids a little pushed, but still sounded good. Sounc quality the momentums had it. Comfort was also best of the bunch. Lambskin really is delightful. It is hot, but its so comfy. NC is NOT anywhere near the other 3 I mentioned, but it is serviceable on a train, just turned up the volume a little bit and was good. better than nothing for sure.

most of the issues people talked about before have been resolved with updates to the firmware of the device and of the app, BT issues, static issues with MBP, turning it on and off while keeping the headphones open. All fixed. This made me feel comfortable knowing that the team at Sennheiser is listening. Overall, I recommend these over anything else.",4
"I ordered the 'New Sennheiser Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto On/Off, Smart Pause Functionality and Smart Control App' to review. So far, and after almost a month of testing and playing with these amazing headphones, I am ready to share my thoughts.

First and foremost I must express that I am really disappointed in the case that Sennheiser has included with these ""High End"" Headphones. I mean come on Sennheiser. It seems pretty standard these days for higher end headphones to come with a nice clam-shell hard case. The case provided is a soft zipper pouch with little to no padding at all. I would not feel comfortable to stuff these into my backpack or even suitcase for that matter.

Now with that said, these headphones ARE solid. The stainless steel headband is sturdy and not fragile. The headphones themselves are of a very nice quality construction with real leather, both on the headband and ear pads. The physical buttons (which I tend to like much better than the new ""touch"" buttons on some of the others out there) are nice and solid and function perfectly.

The sound is absolutely AMAZING! I compared them to my wife's Bose QuietComfort 35 II headphones and honestly I love the sound signature on the Momentum's better. And as for the Noise Cancellation, I honestly can't tell much difference between the two. I do think the Bose do a slightly better job but for the sound quality you get out of the Momentum's, I'll stick with the Momentum's.

As for the weight and comfort compared to the Bose, the Bose are lighter but not necessarily more comfortable. The Momentum's just feel SOLID. The Bose feel nice but light and flimsy.

Other thoughts - Others complain about the ""auto pause"" feature on the Momentum's, but I personally love it. Others complain about the way you have to power these off by folding them up and personally, it doesn't bother me a bit. I would rather that then pressing a button and wondering if you pressed it correctly. This way, you KNOW they are off.

Battery life isn't the greatest compared to many others in this price range but for me it's just fine. I don't travel long distances and for the occasional 5-6 hour flights I rarely take, they will give me what I need. Plus with the much appreciated USB type C charging port, they will charge pretty fast.

Overall I LOVE everything about these, except for the soft flimsy case provided. Sound is fantastic! They are loud with rich thumping Bass, Nice clean Mids and wonderfully crisp Highs and for me the Sound Isolation works great.",4
"SOUND QUALITY - 10 stars with caveats

As one would expect from Sennheiser the sound quality is of the highest quality. I am a classical listener. I want flat accurate reproduction. No pumped up bass, no clipping highs, extreme dynamic range, best quality channel separation (for genuine sound stage). The Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 give you all that, but with some severe limitations.

BLUETOOTH - 2 stars

The Bluetooth features are horrific. Granted, when connected to a decent telephone they perform well. They work well with my Galaxy Note 8.0. But they don't work well at all when connecting to a source with high level Bluetooth features, like Bluetooth HD. The absence of an app with the option to prioritize connection characteristics severely limits the ability to get the best sound. I prefer using a high quality dedicated DAC rather than the limited lower quality DACs in phones and tablets. The poor poor bluetooth implementation of the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 means one cannot tap the full potential of the excellently engineered audio. It is sort of like setting up a dining table with the best china and flatware but only serving microwaved frozen entrees. The Sennheiser superior audio can only deliver superior sound if it gets a likewise superior signal, which these headphones are incapable of.

WIRED MODE - 0 stars

Like bluetooth Sennheiser misses the mark with the included (but limited) capability to use the headphones with a wired connection. Granted, many competitors don't allow a wired connection. But the Sennheiser feature requires a connector with a long enough slim shank to fit into the hole. Most 2.5 connectors will not work because the connector is recessed into a small hole. I have not found a manufacturer of high quality braided cables that can work with the Sennheiser recessed jack. Sure, there are other cables available, but they are no better quality that the cable that ships with the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0. Like the poor bluetooth implementation this means you cannot get the highest quality signal to the headphones.

The bottom line about the Sennheiser Momentum 3.0 is they are very good for use with telephones, and they will shine in sound quality compared with others in this class (Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bowers and Wilkins PX7 for example - there's probably a Bose model others would include but not me - Bose belongs in lower class - Perhaps ""elevator music headphones"") in that mode. But they totally fail to work as well as high quality audiophile grade headphones outside of the Phone arena.",3
"I bought these 1 month ago in a small shop - so now paid review or anything. Coming from the latest Sony NC headphones, I first gave the new Bose 700 NC a try, but ended up with the Sennheiser. In short: Sennheiser please keep on doing what you are doing - they sound amazing. Sure they are some shortcoming when it comes to ANC and battery life, but if you consider sound quality over everything else, give these a try!

I had Sennheiser high-end bluetooth headphones a long time ago and was immediately hooked. When the ANC wave started I went for the Sony MDR-1000X. The ANC was great! I got used to the sound pretty quick and was satisfied. This year I wanted to replace them and went for the latest generation. Sound was very bass driven and didn't catch me. I then bought the latest Bose 700. I have to admit the ANC features of both of them where impressive. The Bose are especially good with low frequent noise. However, sound was weird: mids where too dominant, not exciting, there was a lack of separation of vocals and instruments, and the worst is that the ANC cannot be switched off completely. You could turn it to ""0"" yes, but it still did something. To quote a good review of them: ""They sound like a nervous but kind waitress, who is new in the job: they want to do everything right and somehow manage to do so, but the next day you forgot about them."" I wanted something more. A pair that I could also use at home with excellent sound. So I gave my old love Sennheiser a chance.

First, some critics:
- It is quite annoying that there is no physical on / off switch. One has to fold them to turn them off! (Tip: if you want to store them folded, you can do so, by pressing the play / pause button while unfolding them)
- The bluetooth 5 features are faulty as with all the others: sure you can connect two devices at once. Nice. But try to switch between 3 devices. Everytime one has to bring the headphones to pairing mode and connect them, if the other known devices are in reach
- The adjusting mechanism seems to loose grip over time, let see in a year or so
- battery life: Compared to the competitors the subjective battery life is very poor. When the Sonys lasted around a week on my typical usage, the Sennheiser needed recharge after 4 days. Still okayish
- ANC is by far not as good as the Sonys and not as good as the Bose. Still it will reduce a considerable amount of noise. I would say, the noise of speaking people around you is reduced similarly to the Bose, but low frequency noise not as good. I would say, they are on par with the first generations of Sonys MDR-1000X

Now the good part:
- The sound is amazing! You notice that the engineers at Sennheiser know what they are doing and what they want! Sound prioritized over everything. You can feel, that they first optimized sound that looked how they could do ANC without sacrificing too much. I think Sony and Bose did this the other way around and achieved in this way better ANC with compromises.
- The separation of vocals and instruments is very good, which gives them a very broad and well balanced stage
- They are very agile. The beat drives ahead, where the Sonys and Bose sound slow
- The sound is quite balanced. The bass is strong when it needs to and very crisp. I listen mainly to Punk-Rock, but also like Hip-Hop, old Country, and movie soundtracks. And they manage all of this really good.
- With AptX and AptX low latency, they have perfect protocols that ensure almost no lack when watching movies
- The App is decent and works, but the best is: you don't need it at all! (pointing at Bose ...)
- Build quality is really really good. Basically what you would expect from a German based company

Overall I am very satisfied with these. I had the feeling some of the reviews where a bit off, because one needs to understand the philosophy behind the product. Sure, these are not the best ANC headphones on the market, but if you don't put them in the same corner as the other headphones (unfortunately I could not try the B&W P7X yet), and one looks for superior sound quality, one should definitely give them a try.",5
"These sound amazing. They are comfortable. I love the brand and have some of their other products. This would be a 5 star review - BUT these can't be charged with any old USB C cable - only the one in the box. My apple computer USB C cables won't charge them. I spoke to tech support and these headphones can't charge with a USB C cable that can also carry data! Bose, B&W, Sennheiser's earbuds - no problem. These - no good. So this is a shocking flaw and a real disappointment. I'm hoping they can fix with firmware.",2
"This is mainly a comparison with the prior version in the range, the Momentum 2 (aka M2).

PROS
+ Better sound, particularly in the treble range. The M2 was a little too dark.
+ Exciting bass response. Big, bold, and better defined than the M2.
+ Far more comfortable than the M2. More roomy ear pads/cups.
+ Soundstage is much better vs. the ""in your head"" sound of the M2.
+ BT 5.0
+ USB C
+ Good tactile feedback from rubberized buttons.
+ Ambient Mode can be quickly activated with just a flick of the switch.

CONS
- Plastic ear cups feel cheaper and seem to be of a lower grade plastic than the M2.
- Sliders are not as smooth as the M2. The adjustment feels a bit rough and not as smooth as the M2.
- Soft-ish case. A full hard case for a product costing $400 would have been nice.
- ANC is OK. Does not completely kill out the portable space heater noise in my office (the Sony XM3 eliminates it completely).

In short, everything was improved, except for the build quality, which is still good, but not better than the M2 (although comfort is superior). For $400, I would have liked to see a clear upgrade in all areas over the M2.

BOTTOM LINE
PROS outweigh the CONS. If you want top-tier sound in a portable wireless headphone, but can forego top-tier ANC, these are a great buy. If you want the best ANC, go for the Sony XM3, which still sound good, but don't sound as good as these.",4
"I expected to be blown away by the Sennheiser Momentem wireless headphones simply because it’s a brand that’s supposed to be top notch. However I feel you’re paying for the name & all the cool features rather than sound quality. The features sure are nice though, you can pause a song by simply pulling off your headphones, you can also power off by folding them closed. They pair immediately with your phone, like automatic. They’re obviously built very well which I expect from a brand like Sennheiser, they’re comfortable to wear for extended periods of time, the ear cups are genuine leather I believe. These are obviously very premium in build quality & features but the sound could be better. For the price, i believe they’re are better options. Overall they’re nice headphones just doesn’t match with it’s price point. I probably wouldn’t order again.",3
"I like these headphones very much and they have become my ""go to"" set.

I have been using them daily to listen to music of all kinds as well as the spoken word. I guess a total of about 30 hours of use with 320k MP3s and a few FLAC files as well as some Youtube videos. I'm not an ""audiophile,"" and I don't know if there's anything to the headphone ""break-in"" argument or not, but I first played a pink noise loop through them for perhaps a 100 hours just in case.

Everything seems clear and undistorted with no break up or rattling at high or low frequencies. They give a very even performance across the audio spectrum except for a bump in the low bass and a sharply defined dip in the mid treble at around 4K (you can see the curve at the soundguys website). I prefer a flat audio response curve so I equalized both of these. Most of my listening is on my smartphone with Poweramp V2 which has an excellent 10-band equalizer. Just a few dB down in the low bass and a couple of dB up near mid-treble. Minor but I think necessary to avoid head-thumping bass and pushing female vocalists to the back of the soundstage.

They are noise-cancelling headphones, but the soft leather ear cups do an excellent job of sealing out the rest of the world so nothing interferes with whatever you're listening to without any other intervention. I use them mostly when things are quiet at home or when I'm out walking. In the first case, I don't need ANC and in the second, I don't want it.

The headphones seem well-made. They are comfortable to wear though a little heavy (on my kitchen scale they are 10.75 oz). Unlike other headphones I've seen, they are understated and unobtrusive in appearance--flat black with silver trim.

Bluetooth works reliably for me. And the Sennheisers support having 2 remembered sources which autoconnect whenever the headphones power up.

There is a Sennheiser app that you can download from the Google store. I used it to turn off the auto-pause feature every time I remove the headphones from my head. If you need an equalizer, there is one there as well.

Controls are excellent. Play/pause/phone, Volume up/down, ANC mode and Pairing. There is no power on/off however. You do that by folding/unfolding the headset.

I walk every day for exercise 2 to 3 miles. I think these would be too hot in the summer, so I'll probably stick to my Koss Porta Pros in warm weather. But these Sennheisers are my new daily companions otherwise.",5
"I have long been a fan of Sennheiser products. Doing film / live TV audio work, we always had Sennheiser wireless mics and headphones. My favourite set of headphones is an old pair of corded Sennheiser headphones that I cannot bear to part with. That's why when Amazon was offering a pair of their Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling headphones through Vine, I jumped at the chance.

The sound is great. They last a really long time on a single charge. The noise-canceling function is great, and for the most part, I was impressed. I did subtract one star from my review because for whatever reason during a playback on some film that I know had great sound, they would cut out either intermittently or entirely. I tested it on two different BlueTooth devices and the same thing happened.

Sennheiser, as a rule, is not cheap equipment. When you make the kind of investment in a piece of equipment, you expect it to work 100% of the time.",4
"This Headphone works very well with my iPhone 6+. I was surprised that it interacted so well. After pairing it with the phone, just unfolding and putting in on my head made the two work together again. The headphones were comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The sound quality was better than my ears. On the downside, I tried to use it with my Windows 10 PC and intially, I was quite happy. I paired it with the computer and it showed up on the options to select and everything sounded good. But then for some unknown reason, it decided it would rather play music from my iPhone. Unlike the iPhone, there doesn’t seem to be an app that goes with this headset. I assume this would work with an Andoid based phone as well since there is an app for that. I can’t test that. This is definitely a premium set of headphones.",4
"The sound quality on these is excellent across the board:
*high definition: you will hear every detail from breathing and clothing moving, to the sound of a violin stroke changing direction in the orchestra
*powerful bass: listening to a deep beat is excellent with these
*crisp treble: not tinny, just crisp and clear

The smart pause stops your music when you take the headphones off, so interruptions don’t make you lose your place, whether for podcasts or music.

Pairing was easy, and there are lots of controls on the headphones so you can use them for calls, Siri, dictation, etc..

USB-C: these headphones are compatible with my new MacBook pro, but if you do not have anything with USB-C, this includes an adapter for USB-C to standard USB. The last thing one wants to do is drop more money just to charge these, so it’s good they included this to make it portable and usable.

Speaking of portability, the carry case is soft, which means it won’t protect the headphones well. This looked cheaper than I expected, especially considering that I own significantly cheaper headphones than these with a better case. It might seem petty to point this out, but part of having noise cancelling headphones is usually because you travel and want to block the noise of an airplane, train, or ship engine out. If the case isn’t good for travel, then it’s a problem, and you have to figure out another way to pack these, whether that means buying something that is not a great fit for the size, or just risking it.",4
"This review is for the Momentum Wireless Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto On/Off, Smart Pause Functionality and Smart Control App. I wanted a set of headphones that would be comfortable for me to wear for a few hours with good sound quality. These headphones are very comfortable for me to wear for 3-4 hours and the sound quality for me has been very good. I have not had any popping noises mentioned in other reviews. I have to say at this point however that I have paired these headphones with a Lenovo combination laptop/tablet (running Windows 10) and not a smartphone. The ANC (Automatic Noise Cancelling) works okay for me, but could perhaps be better. I believe the volume of the background noise is probably the biggest factor on how well the ANC works for you. The higher the volume of the background noise the less effective the ANC feature will be. Playing a radio in the background with nothing playing on the headphones I would say the ANC feature cut the volume of the background noise in half, maybe a little more than half. I had no problems at all pairing these headphones with my combo laptop/tablet (Windows 10). One strange thing is that when I activate these headphones the headphones say ""Power On Phone 1 Connected."" I have had no problems fully charging the battery in these headphones. I give these headphones 5 stars for comfort, 5 stars for sound quality (and volume), 3 stars for ANC. Easy to pair. Construction is solid. I give 4 stars overall.",4
"I currently own the HD1 wireless edition (both in black/ivory). I was an early adopter of the BT Momentum HPs when priced @ 500.00 USD.

The 3rd edition’s over-engineered:

1) Removed the tactile on/off button; this is a functional misstep for obvious reasons

2) Redesigned the headband fold down mechanism; this causes physical finger pinch points when collapsing the headset to shut it off (mandatory to power it off).

3) The playback on the redesigned headset is intermittently interrupted due to head movement; the sensors are hyper reactive causing pauses during normal playback.

4) ANC has various modes of filtering; many of which are indistinguishable; a simple toggle on/off would offer less complex engagement by the user

5) The design of the new model loses the retro & nostalgic build of the timeless classic that preceded it; the new model’s bloated in every way (over engineered features that take a step backwards in simple function ) vs. the nimble straight forward design of the elegant older unit. Ex. The split leather headband design, with stitched details, is tossed out completely in favor of a chunky headband that has none of that unique flare.",1
"These headphones sound great. Better than most of the noise cancelling headphones on the market, which is expected - they are Sennheiser. Sennheiser makes all kinds of headphones, but even at the lower levels they put an emphasis on sound quality. These being a higher end headphone, they sound really good.

The touch controls on the side take a bit of getting used to, but are really handy. I wish there was skip forward or back, but having the quick 'active listening' switch so you can hear just your surroundings for a minute is really cool.

The noise cancelling is not as good as Bose, but the headphones sound richer and fuller (to me) than the Bose and all but really loud sounds are cancelled out. In a work environment, they are perfect. On an Airplane, I am not 100% sure they would block out the engine noise but they probably would.

The feature to turn stop the music when you take them off is really great too, but can be sensitive to turning your head. You sometimes get stopped music if you turn too far to either side.

Battery life is really great. I use them for a few hours each day of a week and charge them once a week. They charge pretty quickly too. I usually charge them before I go into a meeting or lunch and they are full in an hour or so (maybe 2 tops).

All in all, if you want great sound and decent noise cancelling you cannot go wrong here.",4
"I bought a pair of these at a local chain retailer. I really like Sennheiser headphones, so getting these made a lot of sense.

Unfortunately, they are very buggy where certain apps stop working, even though you can see the UV/Volume indicator moving but no sound. Then to get those apps (not all of them, some still work), you need to repair the headset to get sound again. Reboots dont work, toggling bluetooth, etc. you have to unpair and repair to get working sound in like 50% of your desktop applications.

I'd love these if they just worked 90% of the time, but I'm debating returning them for Bose or another high end brand due to the annoyances.",2
No Amazon payment plan on these....heck no I'll go with the Bose...,2
These headphone sound amazing and would be a great headset if not for the glaring design flaws. The wired mode does not work with out battery and removes a lot of the benefit of having a wired connection. There is no on off switch and my headset is stuck in wired mode preventing me from ever using it wireless ever again.,2
"super comfortable, premium materials. got these to replace B&W PX7, which were too tight and gave me a headache.",5
Was skiing with these in the main pocket of my backpack when i fell 10 feet onto my back. That wreck broke 2 of my ribs. Headphones were unscathed. Enjoyed their use on the way home. Sound quality is great. 5/5 Would land on again,5
"Great sound quality, crap software",3
